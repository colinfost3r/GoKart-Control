# GoKart Control

A dashboard and shared pit system for eight electric karts at Manresa Island,
Connecticut. Each kart uses a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a 7-inch LESOWN L7-family touchscreen (1024×600 per supplied manual), a
Heltec V4.3 that owns VESC communication over Bluetooth, GPS and LoRa.
The kart Pi is the display/interface computer; it does not own the VESC link. A Pi 4 hosts
the password-protected pit web interface for multiple simultaneous operators.

**The connected development kart is the primary hardware baseline.** The older
M5Stack repository is historical reference, not the specification for this rebuild.

## Start here

1. [Handoff](HANDOFF.md): current status, findings, next tasks and open questions.
2. [Measured VESC baseline](hardware/vesc/baseline-kart/2026-11-05/README.md):
   actual settings, evidence and interpretation.
3. [Requirements](docs/requirements.md): confirmed product behavior and deferred work.
4. [Architecture](docs/architecture.md): components, interfaces and failure boundaries.
5. [Hardware inventory](docs/hardware.md): verified vs reported vs unknown details.
6. [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md): repeatable setup and collaboration conventions
   for Colin and Eamon, including ongoing push/sync expectations.
7. [Telemetry agreement](docs/requirements.md#agreed-telemetry-fields): fields, units
   and proposed validity conventions shared across the components.

## Current status

As of November 5, 2026:

- Read the connected VESC over USB without configuration writes or motor commands.
- Verified firmware 6.00, hardware identity `75_100_V2`, controller ID 69.
- Decoded 189 motor fields and 187 application fields with both schema signatures
  verified and every payload byte accounted for.
- Archived [eight hardware photos and connector notes](hardware/photos/2026-11-05/README.md),
  identifying the L7 display, Heltec V4.3 and Quectel L76K GPS module.
- Captured a stationary telemetry sample: 76.4 V, 22.3 C ESC temperature, no active fault.
- Prepared offline decode tools and protocol tests using the real captured data.
- [Heltec bench firmware](firmware/heltec/README.md) now reads the baseline VESC
  over BLE, receives GPS NMEA and transmits Eamon’s shared 46-byte LoRa telemetry (kart ID 1, BW500). Authenticated
  Wi-Fi OTA has been exercised on the physical board. See [bench results](docs/heltec-bench-test.md).
- This branch has no dashboard/pit app or VESC control. Eamon has a pit-server,
  kiosk and simulator prototype on [PR #1](https://github.com/colinfost3r/GoKart-Control/pull/1);
  its integration with this physical kart remains pending.
- No course image/route is packaged. Outdoor GPS fix, receiver confirmation,
  field coverage, display integration and driving fault-isolation tests remain open.

The captured configuration is the current **runtime** configuration. It is not
proof of the saved flash baseline, a tuning recommendation, or a flashable image.
Do not copy this kart's settings to other karts without inspecting their hardware.

## Product scope

| First implementation | Deferred |
| --- | --- |
| VESC telemetry over BLE; MPH dashboard | Driver messaging |
| ECO/NORMAL/SPORT retained pending inspection | Gradual remote stop |
| Offline course map with all eight kart positions | Geofence enforcement |
| Online/race-entry filters | Current-limit increases pending diagnosis |
| Beginner display hides driver-facing fault alerts | Automatic fault-based tuning |
| Pi 4 password-protected shared pit control | |
| Logs and addressed/fleet profile requests | |

The Heltec handles supervisory telemetry/profile requests; the VESC continues
to run motor control. The display exchanges data and UI requests with the Heltec
over a proposed USB serial interface. Profile writes remain disabled.

**Vehicle reliability comes first.** Display, Heltec or communication failures
must leave the ESC running with its current active settings and hardwired
controls. No automatic restore, profile switch, stop or reset on disconnect or
reconnect. This requirement still needs bench validation; existing ESC protections
remain active. See [reliability requirements](docs/requirements.md#reliability-and-link-loss-behavior).

Throttle and reverse remain wired to the ESC. Pedal braking is mechanical.
Motor braking is currently configured to 0 A. Motors have no temperature
sensors wired; motor temperature must display as unavailable, not 0 C.

## Local setup

Canonical location: `~/Projects/50 Day/GoKart Control/`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:colinfost3r/GoKart-Control.git "$HOME/Projects/50 Day/GoKart Control"
cd "$HOME/Projects/50 Day/GoKart Control"
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

If already cloned, reuse the existing project. Offline tools use Python 3.9+
standard library; no pip dependencies or connected hardware are needed for tests.
Serial capture supports macOS/Linux and requires device permissions. It is not
a Windows serial implementation.

For read-only hardware inspection, follow [tools/vesc/README.md](tools/vesc/README.md).
For Heltec build, USB installation and Wi-Fi OTA, follow
[firmware/heltec/README.md](firmware/heltec/README.md). There is no dashboard or
pit app launch command yet.

The bench firmware uses pinned PlatformIO/Arduino ESP32 dependencies. The
pit prototype lives on Eamon’s branch; kart display implementation remains open. Avoid creating empty service skeletons
until the first runnable milestone has a clear interface and acceptance checks.
