# Hardware photo evidence — November 5, 2026

Eight owner-supplied photos, copied unchanged. [Manifest](manifest.json) records
original filenames, sizes and SHA-256 hashes. These photos identify hardware;
they do not demonstrate powered operation, touch events, GPS fix or LoRa range.

| Photo | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| [1: Heltec front / GNSS](01-heltec-front-l76k.jpg) | WiFi LoRa 32 V4 OLED board, USB-C, and a cabled module marked L76K. |
| [2: Heltec rear](02-heltec-rear-gps-antenna.jpg) | Silkscreen HTIT-WB32LAF V4.3, 8-wire GNSS connection, ceramic GPS patch antenna. |
| [3: packaging](03-heltec-packaging.jpg) | WiFi LoRa 32 V4; printed HF 863–928 range. This is packaging evidence, not a read of configured frequency. |
| [4: display front](04-display-front.jpg) | Landscape panel with corner mounts and attached cables. Screen not displaying a tested image. |
| [5: display rear / Pi](05-display-connectors-pi3.jpg) | 7-inch HDMI TFT board, speakers, HDMI IN, separate 5V IN and 5V IN + TOUCH USB ports; Pi silkscreen reads Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2. |

## Identification

- **Heltec:** HTIT-WB32LAF V4.3, with the pictured GPS daughterboard already attached.
- **GPS:** Quectel L76K module with ceramic patch antenna. No additional GPS module
  is required to implement the proposed design. GNSS serial operation is untested.
- **Display:** LESOWN L7 family, 7-inch IPS, 1024×600 per supplied manual; owner
  identifies this unit as a touchscreen. Capacitive USB-HID touch is documented
  for the touch variants. Exact product suffix is not readable/established here.
- **Revision correction:** 'L7 User Guide Rev 2.1' identifies the supplied manual.
  It is not evidence of a display-controller PCB revision called 'LV rev 2.1'.
- **Kart Pi:** Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 is visible on the actual board. The Pi 4
  box in the background does not change the identity of the pictured connected Pi.

## Connection plan supported by the evidence

1. Pi HDMI to display HDMI IN for video.
2. Pi USB data to the display port labeled **5V IN + TOUCH** for touch input.
   The neighboring **5V IN** port is power-only and cannot carry touch events.
3. Pi USB to Heltec USB-C for the proposed serial bridge. Firmware still needs
   identification/implementation; the photos do not establish a working bridge.
4. Keep L76K on the Heltec GNSS connection. Verify exact V4.3 pin assignment,
   power/reset control and serial settings against the schematic before firmware.
5. VESC link remains BLE, independent of those USB connections.

The supplied manual describes USB-HID touch without a vendor driver. Actual
Linux device enumeration, EDID/display mode, touch mapping and orientation still
need a bench check. Its old Raspberry Pi config.txt examples are historical
installation guidance, not configuration changes to apply blindly to a new OS.

The display and Pi require a regulated accessory supply; the photos do not
establish the kart's supply current capacity or full power budget. Do not infer
that every device can be powered reliably through one Pi USB port.

## Still unverified

- Actual display EDID/native mode, touch operation and chosen mounted orientation.
- Exact display product suffix; 1024×600 is manual-derived pending live confirmation.
- Heltec installed firmware, GPS output/fix/baud, and serial bridge behavior.
- Actual RF frequency/power settings and antenna specification. Packaging supports
  the high-band identification; no radio channel has been configured by this project.
- Whether all development units match the pictured hardware.

## Manufacturer references

- [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4/): ESP32-S3/SX1262 family and GNSS interface.
- [Exact V4.3 schematic](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/WiFi_LoRa_32_V4/Schematic/HTIT-WB32LAF_V4.3.pdf).
- [Heltec expansion reference](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v4-expansion-housing/): Quectel L76K option; not a claim that the pictured separate module is the complete expansion housing kit.
- LESOWN primary evidence is the supplied photographed manufacturer guide above;
  no matching exact-suffix online datasheet was established.

## Later bench observations (added 2026-11-06; the photos and the sections above are unchanged)

Recorded in [HANDOFF.md](../../../HANDOFF.md); these are bench results with the project's own
firmware, not new evidence from the photos.

- **Display:** a Pi 3 B kart display (kart 2) runs cage + Chromium on the L7 at 1024x600 over
  HDMI (2026-11-06 16:26). The kart install pins `video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600M@60` because the panel
  presents no usable EDID. Touch operation, mounted orientation and the exact product suffix are
  still unconfirmed. HDMI audio to the panel's speakers streams (PCM running) but has not been
  listened to.
- **Heltec / GPS:** kart 2's Heltec V4.3 runs `firmware/kart-heltec-v4`; its L76K was detected at
  9600 baud and got outdoor fixes with 5-11 satellites (2026-11-05). On 2026-11-06 that L76K
  stopped driving its TX line (PPS still ticking) and needs replacing; see HANDOFF Known issues.
- **Radio:** the project configures 915.0 MHz, BW500, SF7, CR4/5, sync 0x12, SX1262 at 10 dBm
  plus the V4.3 front end. Antenna specification and transmit power at the antenna are not measured.
- **Power:** still not established; the Heltec should not be powered from the VESC's 3.3 V COMM pin.
