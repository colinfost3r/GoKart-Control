# Collaborator handoff

## Kart 3 M5 modes commissioned; two additional M5 karts planned — 2026-11-10 (current)

**Working hardware:** matching Core2 `m5-espnow` and Heltec `kart-m5-espnow` from source
`4a582f0` are installed. Each segmented USB upload verified four segments and preserved NVS.
Heltec application SHA-256: `11e556e8d525632916f9ef05ac12e8f3f4346ed70f0adfbd6a3ecc3aa08821f2`.
Core2 application SHA-256: `996c4387cb51a16286e89760ac035aa421bfbede608a8f56092f2a319cec9b0a`.
Heltec reports `writes:true`, correct UUID and validated limits; Core2 reports `mode_ready:true`.
Both ESP-NOW peers have driver/received/advertised channel 6 and authenticated alignment.
The ceiling record was learned from a clean configuration read, without writing on boot.
Speed calibration remains **2.48**. Initial telemetry/OTA evidence remains in the historical sections.

**Operator acceptance:** hold a mode button for at least 650 ms, then release. ECO, NORMAL and
SPORT each produced confirmed VESC readbacks: current scales **0.50 / 0.75 / 1.00** and positive
ERPM caps **21661 / 36102 / 150000**. The operator exercised the wired throttle with wheels lifted;
rotation was recorded and sampled fault codes were all zero. Final captured state was confirmed
SPORT, zero ERPM. These are bench observations, not measured road speeds or braking acceptance.
No motor-actuation command, app write or additional persistent tune write was sent in this session.
[Sanitized commissioning evidence](hardware/m5/2026-11-10-kart3/mode-commissioning/README.md).

The full existing pit command implementation is enabled. Periodic LoRa `rate 1` broadcasts were
seen, but separate pit-mode/STOP/SLOW/BOOST/race checks remain open. RF range, eight-kart load,
vehicle-level link-loss acceptance, VESC power-cycle persistence and road testing remain open.
Do not equate compile/host-test success with those hardware checks.

**Source ahead of installed Core2:** a small busy-radio notice tells the driver to release and
hold again if a request cannot be sent. It never queues or replays the held gesture. All three
Core2 variants compile; candidate wireless SHA-256
`35162e477bf917464b88840378913ced7ecab43bed83b333810b4cfba6901df1` is built but **not installed**.
The working installed `996c4387…` image was left in place after the owner confirmed all modes work.
Full offline checks passed **356 tests / seven suites / zero skipped** including the new touch
regression. Test-only mock naming is portable across Clang/GCC; production code was independently reviewed.

**Newest upstream integrated:** `a9c8459` supersedes the `705bd91` full browser restyle:
Eamon restored the original Pi/pit layout while retaining Hunter’s SoNo artwork behind the kart
MAP/SAT toggle. FOLLOW driving-camera behavior and this branch’s roulette cancellation/suppression
fixes remain intact. This changes browser presentation and illustrative assets, not Heltec firmware,
LoRa/ESP-NOW contracts or the native Core2 UI. No shared Pi/pit deployment or additional board
flash was performed here. The SoNo demo is not a surveyed Manresa course.

**Next two karts:** the owner plans two more Core2/Heltec assemblies. Their fleet IDs are not yet
assigned. Use the same firmware architecture, with unique fleet IDs, physical BLE MAC/VESC UUID
pins, ESP-NOW peers/private pair keys and OTA credentials. Capture each VESC before tuning and
preserve that unit’s Hall, pedal and electrical calibration. Never clone another unit’s NVS or
whole VESC configuration. [Bring-up procedure](firmware/m5-core2/BRINGUP.md).

**Reverse investigation:** latest owner correction is **throttle ADC1; reverse RX**, using a
maintained mechanical switch to VESC signal GND and a believed **10 kΩ pull-up RX→3.3 V**.
It remains intermittent even from a complete stop with the pedal released. RX is the expected
pin for the unchanged ADC / Current Reverse Button configuration; the former TX diagnosis is
superseded. Measure RX high/low stability and inspect switch/harness/ground before choosing a
filter or changing ADC settings. Resistor placement and measured levels remain unknown.
[Current reverse notes](docs/reverse-input.md). No reverse-related setting or wiring change was made.
Stock-source review also found a testable interaction between the zero braking limit and FOC
direction-dependent limiting: about 0.05 A may be available during part of a reverse transition.
This is a hypothesis, not a measured cause; no additional tune or motor test was performed.

## Earlier checkpoint: complete capture, tune preparation and upstream integration — 2026-11-10

**Accessory checkpoint is unchanged:** Core2 live telemetry + authenticated OTA and Heltec
`kart-m5-espnow-readonly`. **VESC tune trial applied** at 19:58:55 UTC to UUID
**37004e000951343037353739** / 6.02 / 75_300_R2, with one persistent SET_MCCONF (13), exact ACK
and all 376 fields read back. Exactly 12 motor settings/23 bytes changed; every other motor byte
and all application bytes were preserved. No motor actuation command, reset/detection, firmware
write or new accessory deployment occurred. Runtime readback is verified; power-cycle persistence
and driving behavior are not. [Applied evidence](hardware/vesc/kart3/2026-11-10/tune-applied-v1/README.md).

**Owner scope:** M5 modes plus full existing Eamon pit controls (STOP/START, SLOW/BOOST/RACE/game).
The owner subsequently requested a Desktop backup and a trial tune preserving Hall/pedal and all
calibration while matching the shared driving tune. They confirmed wheels lifted, pedals released
and access to the cutoff. The VESC disappeared from macOS USB after the first capture; two subsequent attempts failed
before opening a device. It then reconnected on the same port. A fresh full snapshot in
`usb-prewrite-connected/` matches all 376 original settings, 82.1 V, 0 ERPM/current, fault 0.
Do not describe failed attempts as backups.
At this earlier checkpoint the owner reported the reverse switch on TX. They subsequently corrected
it to **RX**, with a maintained mechanical switch to VESC signal GND and an approximately 10 kΩ
pull-up to 3.3 V. Intermittent reverse remains unresolved; [current investigation](docs/reverse-input.md).
All input configuration/calibration remains unchanged.

**Actual complete USB capture:** November 10, 19:28:31 UTC, `/dev/cu.usbmodem3041`, four CRC-valid
replies, all **189 motor + 187 app settings**. Compared with the dated November 5 kart-2 reference:
**326 equal, 50 different (40 motor / 10 app)**. All fields have a review disposition. Snapshot:
82.1 V, 0 ERPM/current, fault 0, ESC 19.1 C. Kart 3 is still configured as NTC despite the unwired
motor-temperature sensor; raw -95.4 C is unusable. Motor braking is -50 A versus baseline 0 A;
battery regen -12 A versus -100 A; field weakening 15 A versus 95 A. Those are **pre-tune** values.
The later trial sets motor/braking/battery currents 140/0/100 A, ERPM ±150000, duty 0.95, field
weakening 95 A/start 0.87, open-loop 700/sensorless 4000 ERPM, DC/BLDC ramp 0.04, sensor Disabled.
Battery-charge limit -12 A, absolute current 220 A, minimum VIN 60 V, Hall/pedal/motor electrical
calibration, identity, phase filters, drivetrain metadata and every app setting remain unchanged.
[Evidence](hardware/vesc/kart3/2026-11-10/usb-before-tune/README.md),
[complete comparison and review](docs/kart3-tune-comparison.md).

**Desktop backup:** `/Users/cofo/Desktop/GoKart Control - Kart 3 Backup - 2026-11-10/`, explicitly
requested by the owner. Raw/decoded settings, manifests, review and verified schema were copied and
all 17 bundled files hash-verified. This is a complete runtime settings reference, not a firmware
image or verified saved-flash snapshot. Do not silently import another controller's calibration.

**Latest upstream integrated:** Eamon's `3178a10`, including delayed freeplay item prizes and the
one-second NEW LAP hold. Integration review found that collected-box removal discarded the delayed
prize, and a delayed boost could override mud entered during the spin. The fixes retain earned prizes
across same-course box removal/respawn, cancel them on operator/game/course/session/link boundaries,
recheck freshness/mud at send, and prevent staged commands from crossing an interrupted generation.
The roulette now shows CANCELED and cancels its sound when suppressed. This is Pi game source;
M5 game/roulette parity remains outside the initial v1.5 display scope. Shared pit/Pi deployments
were not performed. Eamon's prior notes on speedcal 2.48, 54-byte game telemetry requiring
base/repeater 0.2.2 and STOP-during-BLE-loss remain applicable; neither shared radio was flashed here.

**Prepared control target:** `kart-m5-espnow` keeps temporary `store=0` supervisory writes, fresh
complete UUID/config proof, atomic per-controller ceiling records, a 500 ms configuration poll and
1000 ms maximum config age. It preserves current untouched duty/watt/braking-scale fields, rejects
invalid/above-ceiling commands before state changes, makes STOP ramps monotonic, clears pending
verification/ramp/duration state on link changes, and never replays commands on reconnect.
A fresh clean baseline read is required; the legacy split-key cache is not imported. Intentional
retuning requires deliberate ceiling reconciliation. No refreshed target has been installed or
physically accepted. Existing STOP/coast and the unloaded optional brake script remain distinct.

**ESP-NOW channel fix prepared:** authenticated private v1 line records carry the Heltec's actual
channel, a rotating challenge and a grant bound to the current Core2 boot. Core2 must retune and
receive fresh proof on that same channel; Heltec independently checks proof before releasing a
request. Maintenance/association/scanning/in-flight TX block retuning, and channel/session changes
invalidate queued grants/commands. Status exposes driver, received and advertised channels separately.
Old firmware retains telemetry but controls require both updated peers. This addresses the observed
Heltec channel 6/Core2 channel 5 acquisition issue in source; actual paired-channel recovery, range
and command delivery still require the supervised hardware test.

**Validation:** all nine affected firmware targets compile. Full-control image SHA-256 is
`11e556e8d525632916f9ef05ac12e8f3f4346ed70f0adfbd6a3ecc3aa08821f2`; prepared wireless read-only
Heltec is `65b28cb9595f4e645afb3aabf5811e7f26136ff4defa4a593795ce6aa1568052`; prepared Core2
is `996c4387cb51a16286e89760ac035aa421bfbede608a8f56092f2a319cec9b0a`. These are not installed
image hashes. Logs are ignored under `firmware/build/review-channel-20261110/`. Game core passes
133 tests; three native RF suites pass with ASan/UBSan; prepare/apply guards have focused fake-serial
tests and independent review. Final `tools/run_tests.sh` completed **355 tests across all seven
suites, zero skipped, ALL PASSED** (56 VESC / 74 pit core / 7 pit e2e / 133 kart core / 9 mapsync /
18 kart e2e / 58 firmware). All changed documentation links resolve and `git diff --check` is clean.
Software tests do not establish physical braking, direction, speed calibration, RF range or driving acceptance.

**Rollback retained:** exact installed Heltec `heltec-working-readonly-f55e3e53.bin` and Core2
`core2-working-ota-c090ce15.bin`, read back and hash-matched, plus original full-flash backups and
private pairing/OTA credentials under ignored `firmware/build/bench-private/20261110-120545/`.
No key/password is in Git. The next section records that earlier installed checkpoint in detail.

## Earlier checkpoint: kart 3 live telemetry and Core2 OTA — 2026-11-10

**Working on hardware:** encrypted ESP-NOW carries real kart 3 VESC telemetry to the Core2.
The owner confirms both DASH/MAP tabs work and live battery/connection readings are visible.
No jumper wires or SD card are required. Core2 accepted an authenticated Wi-Fi application update,
restarted with credentials retained and its update window off, and recovered live ESP-NOW data.
Hold the top status bar for 1.8 seconds, then ENABLE UPDATES, for a ten-minute maintenance window;
USB `ota on/off/status` is also available. See the [OTA guide](firmware/m5-core2/README.md#core2-maintenance-and-ota).
The hardware upload used USB to open that window; the touch maintenance flow still needs an owner check.

**Corrected controller assignment:** the copied historical VESC pin belonged to kart 2.
Eamon's latest `fc7e610` identifies that ownership; the owner confirmed this kart has a different VESC.
Removed the copied pins and commissioned kart 3 read-only with MAC **f7:bd:23:cc:62:0e**,
UUID **37004e000951343037353739**, hardware **75_300_R2**, firmware **6.02**.
Saved pins survived accessory restart and freshly matched the connected controller. Do not reuse the
original 6.00 / 75_100_V2 baseline configuration/schema for this controller without verifying compatibility.
Runtime observations: 82.3–82.4 V, zero ERPM/current, ESC about 17.4 C, fault 0; reported motor current
limit 120 A and battery current limit 90 A. These are reads, not changed settings or complete backups.
Motor-temperature sensors remain unwired; ESC temperature is not motor temperature.

**Installed images:** Core2 `m5-espnow` application SHA-256
`c090ce154e457343b4ab7b99ef39fd4b996fb826c23dc242543ea47d21c4cb63`;
Heltec `kart-m5-espnow-readonly` / kart 0.2.7 application SHA-256
`f55e3e53fe7c36cb0aa64371de528d9d1ac6d1f416b0b9bf3cdce68d7054453e`.
Both segmented USB uploads hash-verified four segments and preserved NVS. Core2 also received the same
application through the official pinned uploader with password authentication and an explicit success ACK.
Private rollback images, captures and Core2 update credentials are under ignored
`firmware/build/bench-private/20261110-120545/`; ESP-NOW recovery keys are under ignored
`firmware/build/bench-private/espnow-pair-20261110T174439Z/`. Never commit these private files.
Heltec `gokart-3.local:3232` advertised `auth_upload=yes`; its OTA transfer is not yet hardware-tested here.

**Mode selection remains disabled:** `ENABLE_VESC_WRITES=0` is installed, so the M5 correctly reports
`mode_ready:false`. The owner has now reported wanting to select modes; the next task is guarded M5 mode
enablement, including fresh UUID/baseline association, rather than silently enabling all pit/game writes.
No motor command, VESC settings/firmware change, automated profile restore or motor test occurred.

**Shared source:** merged Eamon's `fc7e610` (kart 0.2.7 wrong-UUID disconnect). Fixed its UART-only
compile regression by guarding the BLE rejection reset. The wrong-UUID fix does not protect two boards
configured with the same MAC *and* UUID: unique physical assignments are still required.
All seven offline suites pass: **276 tests, zero skipped**. Eight affected targets compile: `m5`,
`m5-demo`, `m5-espnow`, `kart`, `kart-uart`, `kart-m5`, `kart-m5-readonly`, `kart-m5-espnow-readonly`.
No LoRa packet format or radio rate changed. Base/repeater sources are unchanged from the earlier passing builds.

[Sanitized evidence](hardware/m5/2026-11-10-kart3/README.md) includes application hashes and readbacks.
Observed ESP-NOW drops/expiry mean no lossless claim. Eight-kart RF load, physical wrong-key/tamper tests,
prolonged soak and driving acceptance remain open. Native framing/config checks use ASan/UBSan.
Opening USB diagnostics can reset these accessories; those resets were tooling-induced, not a VESC reset.

The sections below are historical checkpoints, superseded by the current status above.

## Kart 3 M5 wireless commissioning — 2026-11-10

**Owner changes:** the newly connected Heltec is **kart 3**, superseding the earlier kart-1
assignment for this board. Use paired ESP-NOW between Heltec and Core2; retain UART as an
option. Eamon stays kart 2. No SD card or jumper wiring is installed. Neither is required for
wireless dashboard telemetry/direct peer GPS positions. A base is optional for those functions;
central pit/race control still uses the base.

**Accessory programming observed:** both boards have complete private 16 MiB rollback images
under ignored `firmware/build/bench-private/20261110-120545/`. Do not publish raw flash, keys,
credentials or private serial captures. The connected Heltec initially emitted factory I/O-test
text and had no GoKart namespace; it was not assumed to contain the older development firmware.
Segmented uploads preserved NVS. Core2 `m5-demo` and `m5`, and Heltec `kart-m5-readonly`, were
uploaded from source `2fd0359` with all four written segments hash-verified per upload. Kart 3,
known VESC MAC/UUID pins and private Wi-Fi/OTA settings were saved and read back after reboot.

**Observed Heltec:** `kart-0.2.6`, BLE transport, `writes:false`, LoRa radio OK, GPS serial data
at 9600 baud with no position fix. A 30-second USB capture contained 60 self reports with median
0.500-second spacing. Wi-Fi joined and `gokart-3.local` resolved to its reported address; an
actual OTA firmware transfer has not been tested. One cumulative malformed LoRa receive was
reported, so this is not evidence of zero RF loss. The owner reports seeing kart 3 in the pit.
Pit/control rejection is expected: all VESC writes are disabled and the VESC remains off.

**Touch:** owner reported the original small tabs did not switch. A temporary standalone
four-box diagnostic captured all four presses with matching raw/display coordinates and
working IRQ39; the owner confirmed its boxes responded. Production tabs are now 40 pixels
high and outlined, sharing drawing/hit bounds. Final dashboard touch confirmation remains
pending. The temporary diagnostic is ignored build output, not production functionality.

**Wireless implementation:** `m5-espnow` + `kart-m5-espnow-readonly` retain the same M5 JSON and
LoRa contracts. Pairing uses private independently generated LMK/PMK, pinned MACs, encrypted
unicast plus fragment authentication, bounded buffers/age, and channel recovery. No wireless
text reaches the USB console, no reconnect commands are replayed, and write-enabled wireless
compilation is refused for this first milestone. See [M5 guide](firmware/m5-core2/README.md),
[bring-up](firmware/m5-core2/BRINGUP.md) and [transport](firmware/libraries/M5EspNowLink/README.md).
The USB pairing tool stores its recovery keys privately before either board's NVS is changed.
Pairing is atomic per board, not across the two boards.

**Validation:** all seven offline suites pass: 269 tests, zero skipped. All ten targets
compile: `m5`, `m5-demo`, `m5-espnow`, `kart-m5`, `kart-m5-readonly`,
`kart-m5-espnow-readonly`, `kart`, `kart-uart`, `base`, `repeater`. The final receive-time/queue
fix was followed by both wireless builds and all 30 firmware tests again. Native framing,
malformed-packet and pairing-corruption checks use ASan/UBSan. HMAC wrong-key/tamper injection
and physical radio behavior remain separate acceptance work.

**Current acceptance boundary:** wireless source/build checks are complete;
new wireless images and pairing have not yet been recorded as installed in this checkpoint.
The larger final tabs, actual Heltec/Core2 wireless reception, VESC BLE telemetry, outdoor GPS,
RF coexistence, channel/loss recovery, eight-kart load and actual OTA upload need hardware
results. No motor test, VESC configuration change or write-capable deployment was performed.

The following integration section records the state before these accessory programming steps.

## M5 first telemetry integration — 2026-11-10

**Latest upstream:** merged Eamon's `b48c5ad` into `v1.5/m5-core2` without changing his
branch. Today's changes are kart **0.2.6** remembered controller baselines / readback retry
(`83e7dc2`) and the local map development kit (`b48c5ad`). The merge also includes his
post-sync work from last night: timed SLOW, multiplayer FREEPLAY, pit map editing and Pi Wi-Fi
recovery. The existing M5 display scope remains telemetry, mode requests and the simple map;
it ignores game-only fields and does not host, join or attack a multiplayer session.

**First hardware target:** `m5-demo`, then `m5` + **`kart-m5-readonly`**, kart **1**.
The read-only flag still gates temporary VESC limits and custom-app braking, including game
hits and timed effects. The baseline fix reads VESC state and may save baseline metadata in
**Heltec NVS**; it does not restore settings to the VESC on boot/reconnect. Retain each board's
full private backup before flashing. Do not use the upstream write-enabled release image for
this first test. Keep the VESC powered off until the old M5 BLE app has been replaced.

**Compatibility:** upstream telemetry now supports 46/47/54-byte radio frames, with the kart
still sending 47 bytes while no game fields are active. Active multiplayer needs updated
base/repeater firmware (0.2.2). M5's existing parser ignores the new fields; merged emitters
retain the larger 700-byte fleet / 940-byte self buffers and both UART mirror calls. Tests cover all three packet lengths and the larger JSON payloads. Wide-value test reports
fit at 644/700 bytes for fleet and 781/940 bytes for self plus extras.

**Validation:** all seven offline suites pass: **267 tests, zero skipped**. All eight targets
compile on ESP32 core 3.3.8: `m5-demo`, `m5`, `kart-m5-readonly`, `kart-m5`, `kart`, `kart-uart`,
`base`, `repeater`. The 600-second virtual eight-kart run processes 11,170 frames / 6,079,844
bytes; peak scheduled burst 5,310 bytes/500 ms is 46.1% of ideal UART capacity, not measured
hardware throughput. Read-only build options explicitly include `-DENABLE_VESC_WRITES=0`.
Whitespace checks pass. The temporary toolchain had been partially cleaned overnight and was
restored to the same pinned compiler/library versions before these builds.

**Hardware status:** no USB boards were enumerated at the latest check; the owner is connecting
them. No hardware upload or VESC command has been issued in this session. The next step is
identify the explicit Core2/Heltec ports, retain private full-flash backups, then install the
Core2 demo and the read-only telemetry pair. The boards can be programmed separately by USB;
the three-wire link is needed for live telemetry. Keep the VESC off until the old Core2 BLE
app is replaced, then turn it on for telemetry only.

**Before a later write-capable deployment:** harden Eamon's remembered-baseline association.
The current cache path can use a retained UUID before a fresh identity reply, and the separate
NVS UUID/float writes are not an atomic record. Require fresh matched controller identity and
a validated atomic record (or invalidation until all fields are saved). This does not defeat
the compile-time VESC write gate in today's telemetry-only build. Coordinate the change with
Eamon before commissioning mode writes; do not label a cached RAM baseline a saved VESC backup.

The 2026-11-09 sections below describe the previous tested milestone and remain historical.

## M5 v1.5 milestone — 2026-11-09

**Branch:** `v1.5/m5-core2`, based on Eamon's `8d9c41c` (including his 0.2.3 speed
calibration, Pi changes and new Pi-only FREEPLAY feature). Worktree is `.worktrees/m5-v1.5`
in Colin's canonical project; his integration checkout and untracked CAD work are untouched.
This milestone adds the display option requested by the owner; it does not merge or deploy either branch.

**Implemented:** `firmware/m5-core2` has a 320x240 Core2 dashboard, GPS MPH, electrical/ESC
telemetry, mode requests with pending/confirmed/unknown outcomes, and a simple eight-kart
north-up map. Optional SD course outlines export from the existing pit `zones.json`.
The normal M5 build has no BLE/VESC client. `m5-demo` generates labeled synthetic data and
never initializes the control UART. Full details: [M5 README](firmware/m5-core2/README.md).

**Compatibility:** opt-in `kart-m5` / `kart-m5-readonly` builds add a dedicated 230400-baud
UART2 bridge on Heltec G47 TX / G48 RX. Normal Pi firmware paths are unchanged. No LoRa
wire format, slots/rates, base firmware, pit API, motor profiles, calibration or field-
weakening values were changed. Metadata supplies caps/calibration from the Heltec at runtime.
M5 requests use driver source 0xFE, so they do not release pit SLOW. A pinned UUID is required;
STOP/GRID/busy/OTA/baseline-suspect requests are rejected, not deferred. CRC, short-lived
single-use tokens and bounded line processing protect the local request path. These tokens
expire requests only; they never alter the running VESC on communication loss.

**Bench preparation (2026-11-09):** owner confirmed **Core2 v1.3 / K010-V13** and plans wiring
on **2026-11-10**. [First-session guide](firmware/m5-core2/BRINGUP.md) covers the exact cable,
build targets, expected results, identity checks and a troubleshooting/results checklist.
An eight-point shop outline is exported locally to ignored `firmware/build/m5-bringup/course.json`
for an SD test; it is not Manresa course data. The exporter reproduces it from the shared pit track.

**Pre-bench fixes:** Heltec publishes new mode-token metadata immediately after rotation or a
readiness/link-session change, avoiding the old wait until the next periodic report. An expired
in-flight frame can still become unknown; requests are never replayed. The display preserves
reported GPS age instead of renewing an old fix on receipt (including own precise millisecond age).
Periodic telemetry/metadata is **2 Hz**, screen redraw **5 Hz**; no radio or VESC polling rate changed.

**Host simulation:** 600 virtual seconds, eight karts, 11,170 frames / 5,224,444 bytes, including
cable/GPS/peer loss, corrupt lines, late acknowledgements and restart recovery. Peak scheduled
burst 4,582 bytes per 500 ms is 39.8% of ideal 230400-baud 8N1 capacity. This is encoding/parser
and state validation, not physical latency/buffering evidence: a fully simultaneous burst exceeds
the Heltec's 4096-byte TX ring, so hardware burst/drop behavior remains part of commissioning.

**Validation:** all seven offline suites pass (236 tests, zero skipped), including five M5 host
checks with the original 162 C++ assertions plus stream/recovery/GPS-age scenarios under
address/undefined-behavior sanitizers. All six affected targets compile with ESP32 core 3.3.8:
`m5`, `m5-demo`, `kart-m5`,
`kart-m5-readonly`, `kart`, `kart-uart`. `git diff --check` passes. These are host/build
results; physical acceptance is still pending.
**Hardware:** no M5, Heltec, VESC, pit or repeater has been flashed, commanded or rewired in
this milestone. Wiring/power, actual UART throughput, screen/touch/SD behavior, real radio
interoperability and mode readback remain pending. The first hardware path is M5 demo,
then `m5` + `kart-m5-readonly`; see the ordered checklist in the M5 guide.

**Collaboration:** changes concentrate in `firmware/m5-core2`, `M5DisplayLink`, an optional
adapter in the shared kart sketch, build targets and tests. Integrate this focused diff into
Eamon's active branch through its draft PR; no changes are pushed directly onto his branch.
Older handoff sections below include historical/reported state and unresolved document drift.
In particular, they do not prove Colin's installed read-only telemetry image was upgraded.
Colin's PR #4 integration safeguards and Eamon's current write/OTA policy still need separate
reconciliation; M5 source compatibility is not field validation of those policies.

**Future tuning direction (owner, 2026-11-09):** the karts felt slow before field weakening
was introduced (owner observation, not a new measurement). Prefer calibrated RPM limits for
ECO/NORMAL while retaining strong acceleration; retain field weakening for a possible boost
mode. This is a tuning direction, not approved new values or permission to change settings.
Captured maximum field-weakening current remains 95 A. Eamon's present BOOST is a temporary
current-scale/speed-cap override, not a newly implemented field-weakening boost. No such
change is included in v1.5. Validate drivetrain calibration and per-kart caps before tuning.

Updated 2026-11-06 (night), branch `eamon/firmware-lora-starter`. Read this, then
[README.md](README.md) for the architecture and quick starts. Each component has its own
README with full detail: [firmware](firmware/README.md), [pit](pit/README.md),
[kart](kart/README.md), [tools](tools/README.md).

Labels used below: **owner decision** (recorded as decided), **proposal** (built or suggested,
awaiting a decision), **verified** (seen on real hardware, with who/when), **simulated** (tests
and headless renders on a Mac only).

## What it is

Eight electric karts at Manresa Island, CT. Each kart has a VESC 6.00 motor controller with
wired throttle/reverse and mechanical brakes, a Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4.3 with a Quectel L76K GPS
that owns the VESC link over BLE, and a Raspberry Pi 3 B with a 7-inch LESOWN L7 1024x600 touch
panel that is display only. The pit has a Raspberry Pi 4 with a touch panel and a LilyGo T-Beam
S3 Core as the LoRa modem; a second T-Beam can act as a one-hop repeater. On top runs an
optional game layer (boost pads, mud, item boxes, laps, race start/finish, running positions,
synthesized sounds).

One to three development karts are planned, including one each for the owner and Eamon. Do not
assume all eight karts are configured identically. The owner's standing instruction: **the
connected kart is the starting point, ahead of the original GitHub app.**

Hardware in hand (from the bench logs):

| Unit | Board | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kart 1 | Colin's Heltec, kart build flashed by Colin 2026-11-05 | Transmits with VESC linked; receives nothing (see Known issues) |
| Kart 2 | Eamon's Heltec V4.3 (`gokart-2.local`, 192.168.151.44) + Pi 3 B `gokart-kart-2` | Running; GPS daughterboard dead |
| Colin's VESC | the baseline controller (fw 6.00, `75_100_V2`, id 69) | Used for both kart 1 and kart 2 tests, one Heltec at a time |
| Pit | Pi 4 `gokart-pit.local` (192.168.151.240 on McLab) + T-Beam S3 on `/dev/tbeam` | Running; rebooted several times 2026-11-06 |
| Repeater | second T-Beam S3 | Running an older build; needs reflash |

## Current state (2026-11-06)

### Verified on hardware (all at 50 Day St, bench distances)

- **VESC baseline** (2026-11-05, USB, read-only): firmware 6.00, hardware `75_100_V2`, controller
  id 69; 189 motor and 187 app fields decoded with schema signatures verified; stationary sample
  76.4 V, ESC 22.3 C, no fault. No settings written.
- **Pit station** (2026-11-05): Pi 4 kiosk at the panel's 1024x600, pit server, T-Beam on
  `/dev/tbeam`, card made with `pit/sdcard`.
- **LoRa link** (2026-11-05): kart 2 received by the pit at 1 Hz, consecutive sequence numbers,
  zero loss, RSSI -13 dBm / SNR 13.5 dB side by side; later at 2 Hz with 50 ms slots. Kart 2 also
  hears kart 1 directly (kart-to-kart positions work).
- **Commands** (2026-11-05, kart 2): `ping` applied in 1-2 s, `stop` -> `no_vesc` and `start` ->
  `rejected` with no VESC attached (the honest answers).
- **Kart 1 over BLE** (2026-11-05, Colin): kart build at 2 Hz with the VESC linked over BLE,
  78.4 V, ESC 24 C, fault 0, received by the pit and kart 2.
- **First remote STOP on a real VESC** (2026-11-05 17:40, Eamon's Heltec as kart 2 pinned to
  Colin's controller by address + UUID, Colin's Heltec unplugged): each ramp step acknowledged and
  read back (scale 0.5, 0.2, 0.0); START restored 1.0.
- **OTA** (2026-11-05): kart 2 updated over WiFi (ArduinoOTA) into the BLE build.
- **Repeater** (2026-11-06): relays 100 % of kart 2's packets and every beacon, zero drops; pit
  drops the duplicate copies, loss stays 0 %; ping via the pit applied in 0.3 s with the repeater
  on; heartbeat chip at 16:43 showed repeater id 1, -3 dBm, carrying kart 2, age ~1 s.
- **Radio power 0.2.1** (2026-11-07 12:25): base and repeater reflashed with the SX1262 at 22 dBm
  (was 20) and boosted receive gain; stat lines carry `tx_dbm`. Bench: base `fw base-0.2.1`,
  `sync pps`; repeater `rx_bad 0`, `pit_age_s 0`, heard = relayed, heartbeat decoded at -15 dBm /
  SNR 12. The kart build drives its KCT8103L front end at 16 dBm (about 27 dBm radiated, was 10 ->
  ~23) with a stored `txpower 0..22` console override; built, **not flashed** (kart 2 was off).
  Radio parameters (915.0 MHz, BW500, SF7) are unchanged, so old and new builds interoperate.
- **Kart Pi 3 B** (2026-11-06 16:26): card from `kart/sdcard` booted, ~6 min to services up;
  cage + Chromium on the 1024x600 HDMI panel; `/dev/heltec` link reading kart 2; shop map pulled
  from the pit. HDMI audio: the vc4-hdmi PCM runs (IEC958, 48 kHz, 2 ch) while the page plays;
  nobody has listened yet.
- **Live chain bench** (2026-11-06, `tools/bench/e2e_bench.py`, kart 2): 16 checks pass (commit
  cc5c406). The kart-display race check was corrected afterwards (8146fd3); no run of the
  corrected check is recorded.
- **Kart 2 GPS outdoors** (2026-11-05 evening): fix with 5-11 satellites, shown on the shop map.

### Simulated only (tests + headless renders on the Mac)

- Game layer end to end: zones editor, GAME ON/OFF, boost / mud / item / lap line / track, laps
  and leaderboard on the pit, geofence engine and racing HUD on the kart. Real pit zones were
  `enabled: false` at deploy; nobody has driven through a zone.
- Race finish, STOP RACE, final results, race length, running positions carried in the beacon
  (27-byte beacon, committed 20:33) and the kart "P3" badge (committed 20:45).
- Kart GPS fusion (5 Hz `gps` line, hdop/sats gating, outlier rejection, 1.2 s dead reckoning),
  pit GPS correction (off by default), demo mode (rendered headless against kart 2's server).
- Pit reboot hardening (persistent Wi-Fi keyfiles + eth0 fallback, persistent journal, health
  chip, check timer, page self-reload, `why_rebooted.sh`): committed and deployed to the live pit
  2026-11-06 20:59 (1227ab4); not yet proven across a real power cut. See
  [pit/README.md](pit/README.md) "If the pit reboots".
- Pace car track recorder (record a kart's laps on the pit, use one as the track route):
  committed + deployed 20:59 (1227ab4), simulator-tested, never driven.
- Test counts at the last commits: pit 53 core + 6 e2e, kart 78 core + 9 mapsync + 5 e2e, VESC
  tools 8 (`tools/run_tests.sh`, all passing 2026-11-06 with the working tree as it stood).

### Open (not started or not yet tried)

- BOOST and the race grid hold against a live VESC (SLOW, ECO/NORMAL/SPORT caps, STOP and START were
  verified wheels-up on 2026-11-09, see History).
- Kart 2's Pi lost its Wi-Fi after the 2026-11-09 brown-out reboots (same netplan failure as the pit on
  2026-11-06); kart/install.sh now writes keyfiles like the pit, applied to kart 2 on 2026-11-09 18:31
  over a direct Ethernet link (its netplan yaml was 0 bytes). The Pi 3 B still needs a 5 V 3 A supply
  (Known issues 10): the kart display's log of the Heltec's serial shows the reboot storm's resets were
  preceded by `E BOD: Brownout detector was triggered` (36x), several right after `vesc link up` (the
  BLE connect current spike), plus 9 task-watchdog resets and two Guru Meditation panics typical of a
  sagging rail. Power, not firmware. `txpower 12` would ease it at ~2 dB of range.
- Range test, dead-zone test with the repeater, eight-kart load test, PPS at the base (indoors).
  Kart 2 runs 0.2.2 (OTA 2026-11-07 20:14). The `dmesg -w` USB-reset watch (750 mA peaks at 27 dBm
  off the Pi's USB) is still owed: it needs the Heltec actually cabled to the kart Pi, and on
  2026-11-07 it was powered separately; `txpower 14` or `12` if it resets. Give the kart Pi 3 B a
  5 V 3 A supply first: it browned out that evening with only the panel on it (`get_throttled`
  0x50005, see Known issues 10).
  Then the antennas: a 3-6 dBi 915 MHz omni on a mast for the pit base (short low-loss coax), the
  repeater high on a pole mid-track with line of sight both ways, kart whips vertical on the dash
  hood. Height and placement are worth more than every firmware change made today.
- **Base and repeater still on 0.2.1 (reflash owed, 2026-11-09 evening).** Kart firmware 0.2.5 adds 7 game
  bytes to telemetry (54-byte packet, docs/freeplay-multiplayer.md); a 0.2.1 base/repeater rejects that
  length, so 0.2.5 karts send the old 47-byte packet while they are not in a game (nothing lost until
  someone hosts). Images are built: `firmware/releases/base-tbeam-s3-0.2.2.merged.bin` (copy it with
  `scp firmware/releases/base-tbeam-s3-0.2.2.merged.bin pit@gokart-pit.local:` and run
  `ssh pit@gokart-pit.local ./flash_base.sh base-tbeam-s3-0.2.2.merged.bin`; the Mac-side session policy
  refused to run that flash itself) and
  `firmware/releases/repeater-tbeam-s3-0.2.2.merged.bin` (USB from the Mac: `./build.sh repeater upload
  /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX`, or esptool with the merged image at 0x0). Until then the pit shows a kart as
  offline while it is in a multiplayer game.
- Touch, map redraw speed and demo mode by eye on the Pi 3 B panel.
- Formal bench validation of link loss / reconnect (requirements acceptance checks) before
  enabling profile writes; saved-flash VESC baseline; controller commercial model and ratings.
- Drift-cutoff logging (see below).

## How to operate a session

**Pit boot.** Power the Pi 4 with the official 5.1 V 3 A supply, T-Beam on USB, panel on HDMI0
with its touch USB on "5V IN + TOUCH". The kiosk opens by itself (`gokart-pit` +
`gokart-kiosk` services). Top bar: radio link, repeater chip (if one is out), GAME chip, SOUND
chip, and a health chip only when something is wrong (UNDERVOLT, throttled, had undervolt). If
the code changed since the last session, run `pit/deploy.sh` from the Mac first (last deployed
2026-11-07 20:19 with `--install`, 5d2f891; kart Pi the same evening, 20:18).

**Kart boot.** Power the kart Pi and the Heltec (a separate regulated 5 V for the Heltec is the
target, not the VESC 3.3 V pin). The kart Pi wants its own 5 V 3 A: the Pi 3 B logged
under-voltage and throttling with just the touch panel on it (2026-11-07), and a Heltec on its
USB adds 750 mA transmit peaks. The Heltec's USB-C must go to the Pi's USB-A or the driver page
shows USB (no link) and the kart runs on LoRa alone. The Heltec connects only to its pinned VESC; its OLED and the
driver page show the link. The driver page's PIT chip shows how well the kart hears the pit
(`base_rssi`; NO PIT at 0). Maps and zones arrive whenever the kart Pi reaches the pit over Wi-Fi
and survive reboots on the track. In the pit, `ping` each kart once.

**Start a race.** Zones drawn and saved on the operator page (ZONES), GAME ON. In the race panel
(operator page, kiosk RACE tab, or phone): choose 3 / 5 / 10 s and the laps (OPEN, 3, 5, 10), then
hold START RACE 1 s. Every kart holds at zero current (GRID) and gets GO at the same GPS-clock
instant; pages show the five-light countdown.

**Stop a race.** Hold STOP RACE 1 s: laps freeze, karts are placed and shown FINISH, final
results appear; NEW RACE clears them. STOP RACE does not stop karts. To stop karts use STOP per
kart or the hold-to-fire STOP ALL; START releases. GAME OFF is the race director's kill for zone
effects.

**Demo mode.** Kart display: hold the KART badge 3 s (config `demo: true`, the default). A
simulated kart drives the pit's track or zones on the real panel for up to 180 s; nothing is
written to the real Heltec. Hold again to end. Pit side: run the simulators on a laptop
(README quick start).

**When something breaks.**

| Symptom | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Pit page frozen or blank | Pages reload themselves when the server restarts or their event stream dies for 20 s; else `ssh pit@gokart-pit.local sudo systemctl restart gokart-pit gokart-kiosk`. A JS error once killed every page (duplicate `gc`, fixed in 5ee4b76): check the browser console |
| Pit rebooted / no Wi-Fi | `sudo /opt/gokart-pit/tools/why_rebooted.sh` (add `-2` for the boot before); an UNDERVOLT / "had undervolt" chip means supply or cable. Wi-Fi by hand: pit/README.md "If the pit reboots" |
| Kart missing on the pit | Kart console `status`: `lora_rx`, `lora_rx_bad`, `sync`, `built`. Repeater LOST: check it is powered and reflashed |
| Kart not hearing the pit | Same `status`; compare firmware build with kart 2's; swap boards to isolate (kart 1 case) |
| No VESC link | `blescan`; a VESC connected to anything else (VESC Tool, another Heltec, Colin's bench image) does not advertise. `vescmac` must match |
| No GPS | `gpspin` (edges on RX and PPS), `gpsdump`, `gpstest 9600`, `gpsrecover`, `gpscold`. Indoor fixes are ~200 m off and frozen: test outside |
| Command `no_ack` | Kart offline or out of range; outcome unknown, nothing is replayed. Re-send by hand |
| OTA cannot find `gokart-N.local` | `espota.py -i <ip> -p 3232` (arduino-cli mDNS discovery fails; espota by IP works) |
| T-Beam will not take an upload | Still on Meshtastic: 1200-baud touch (firmware/README.md "Repeater"). Base re-flash from the Pi: `esptool --no-stub`, app only at 0x10000 |
| SD card flash stops at the boot partition | flash.sh now waits 5 min; both real cards needed a manual copy before that fix |
| No sound | Pit: tap once (TAP FOR SOUND, no autoplay flag). Kart: `GET /api/sound-test?alsa=1` from the Pi |
| Shop map dot looks off | Expected 25-40 m with SkyFi at the shop (use the CT ECO preset); also see History 2026-11-05 |

## Known issues

1. ~~**Kart 2 GPS board dead**~~ (2026-11-06): the L76K daughterboard no longer drove its TX line
   (0 edges after a 5 s cold power-off; PPS still ticking); most likely damaged by the earlier
   swapped-pin search driving the module's TX; the firmware now never swaps UART pins (6c3bf58).
   2026-11-07 20:15: kart 2 reports a 10-satellite fix again over LoRa, so the board was replaced
   or recovered; note which board is fitted before trusting it on track.
2. ~~Repeater needs a reflash~~ Done 2026-11-07 12:22: repeater on 0.2.1 from the Mac
   (`rx_bad` 0, every beacon relayed, heartbeat decoded by the pit); the pit base on 0.2.1 from the
   pit Pi itself (`~/flash_base.sh <merged.bin>`, esptool in `~/esptool-venv`; the Debian esptool
   package lacks the S3 stub). Kart 2's Heltec: 0.2.2 by OTA 2026-11-07 20:14 (0.2.1's radio
   change rode along).
3. **Pit reboot cause unknown.** On 2026-11-06 the pit Pi rebooted several times, came back with no
   Wi-Fi profile, and the logs were gone (volatile journal; netplan-backed profiles left as 0-byte
   files; the Wi-Fi loss was at 18:10). Wi-Fi and log loss are fixed by 1227ab4 (deployed); the
   reboot itself is not explained. Next occurrence: `why_rebooted.sh`, check for under-voltage.
4. **Kart 1 receives nothing** (Colin's board, 2026-11-05): transmits fine, but hears no beacon and
   no commands. Same firmware as kart 2, so suspect the board (antenna, V4.2 vs V4.3 front end, or
   an older build). Needs its console `status` (`lora_rx`, `lora_rx_bad`, `built`) or a board swap.
   It also must be rebuilt from this branch (decision 2 below).
5. **Nothing has been driven through a real zone yet.** All game evidence is simulated.
6. **Boost and race have not run on a live VESC.** First test: one boost pad on a straight, kart in
   ECO, wheels up, confirm the scale read-back rises and drops after 5 s; then a race with one kart.
7. ~~27-byte beacon / P-badge flashing not recorded~~: the base build is on the pit base (0.2.1,
   2026-11-07 12:25) and the kart P-badge firmware is on kart 2 (0.2.2 by OTA, 20:14). The P badge
   has still not been seen in a real race (the pit sends race positions since 1227ab4).
8. One base build (queue dedupe + a different window expression) stopped receiving entirely on
   2026-11-05 and was reverted; cause not understood.
9. `base_rssi` 0 means "not heard", but side by side the true RSSI is 0 to -1 dBm, so the pit can
   show 0 on the bench. Outdoors it reads normally.
10. **Kart Pi 3 B under-voltage** (2026-11-07 20:14): `vcgencmd get_throttled` 0x50005 (under-voltage
    and throttled, now and since boot), six "Undervoltage detected" lines in dmesg, the touch panel
    dropped and re-enumerated once; the Heltec was NOT on its USB at the time. Supply or cable. The
    kart display now carries the pit's health chip so it shows UNDERVOLT on the panel (kart/README.md).

## Learnings and tips (2026-11-10)

Distilled from the 2026-11-09/10 sessions; the details are in History and the sections above.

- **Pin every Heltec to its own controller, mac AND uuid.** Per kart: `id N`, `vescmac <that kart's
  controller>`, then `vescuuid now` while connected to it. A Heltec with no controller gets `vescmac
  clear`. Do NOT clone one kart's flash/config onto another without re-pinning: that is how kart 3 (pinned
  to kart 2's controller mac) connected to kart 2's VESC and, on the old firmware, squatted on the single
  BLE slot so kart 2's own Heltec was locked out ("VESC link down" while the controller was on and in
  range). 0.2.7 makes a Heltec release a controller whose uuid is not its own, but that only fires when the
  kart has its own `vescuuid` pinned.
- **Caps/speed are per-kart and only as right as the controller's drivetrain numbers.** The "stuck in ECO,
  boosts do nothing" failure was a Heltec reboot (OTA/brown-out) reading back the previous session's
  leftover caps and clamping every mode to 15 mph. 0.2.6 remembers a clean baseline per controller uuid in
  NVS and recovers automatically; if a kart is ever stuck slow, key it off and on. The honest fix is still
  `si_motor_poles`/`si_gear_ratio`/`si_wheel_diameter` in VESC Tool per kart, then `speedcal 1.0` (there is
  a 2.48 calibration fudge today covering wrong drivetrain numbers — see Decisions).
- **Update the WHOLE fleet before using the game.** Multiplayer telemetry is 54 bytes; a base/repeater/kart
  older than 0.2.5 rejects it, so a kart disappears from the pit (and a repeater won't relay it) for as long
  as it is in a game. The base and repeater are still on 0.2.1 — reflash them to 0.2.2 first (images built,
  firmware/releases). See Open items.
- **STOP during a BLE blip (firmware review, HIGH).** A STOP pressed while the VESC link is momentarily down
  returns NO_VESC, which is then cached (W6 dedup, 30 s); the pit's retransmits are deduped to that cached
  result and never re-attempt once the link returns, so the kart can stay at speed until a fresh STOP press.
  Mechanical brakes are the only backstop today. Fix direction: latch STOP intent and ramp once on reconnect
  for STOP only, or never cache a NO_VESC terminal result for STOP/START. (Full review in the session notes.)
- **Hardware beats firmware for the two real limits.** The Pi 3 B browns out (`get_throttled` 0x50005)
  running the panel + Heltec off its USB — give each a solid 5 V 3 A supply. Range is antennas and placement
  (pit antenna on a mast, a repeater mid-course with line of sight), not firmware tuning.
- **Operational:** don't type at the Heltec USB console while the Pi's gokart-kart service owns the port — it
  races and garbles the command; use the server or stop the service first. `kart/sdcard/flash.sh` can time
  out auto-mounting the boot partition at the end; the manual fallback it prints (mount `s1`, copy
  build/{user-data,network-config,meta-data}, eject) is reliable, and set `KART_ID` before flashing. The
  whole stack runs in a local sim with no hardware (`kart/sim/run-sim.py`), which is how map/UX work (Hunter,
  kart/MAP-DEV.md) stays off the live karts; deploy to karts with `kart/deploy.sh`, firmware by OTA
  (`espota.py -i <ip>`).

## Decisions for Colin

- **Drivetrain numbers in the controllers are wrong by ~2.5x** (2026-11-09, measured on kart 2: GPS vs ERPM).
  Firmware 0.2.3 carries a 2.48 speed calibration so the mph caps are real; the clean fix is correcting
  si_motor_poles / si_gear_ratio / si_wheel_diameter in VESC Tool on every kart (then `speedcal 1.0`).

1. **Regen on STOP** (proposal). STOP currently ramps the current scale to zero and the kart
   coasts. The Heltec also sends a brake request to an on-VESC LispBM script
   (`firmware/vesc-lisp/gokart_brake.lisp`), which is a no-op unless the script is loaded and Motor
   Current Max Brake is above 0 (this fleet's baseline is 0 A). Loading the script and enabling
   brake current are per-kart VESC Tool steps and an owner decision; see
   [firmware/vesc-lisp/README.md](firmware/vesc-lisp/README.md).
2. **Rebuild kart 1 from this branch** (request). Its build predates the relay bit, the 47-byte
   telemetry, `slow_mph`, BOOST, RACE and the 27-byte beacon. Prebuilt image and console steps:
   [firmware/releases/README.md](firmware/releases/README.md) (that image is 0.1.0 and also
   predates them: build from source with `./build.sh kart`). Rollback: `pio run -t upload` from
   your branch.
3. **BLE binding: one Heltec per VESC** (owner decision 2026-11-05, recorded by Eamon in person:
   BLE on every kart). The Heltec connects only to the address pinned with `vescmac`, optionally
   also checking the UUID (`vescuuid`); unpinned it scans and never connects. A VESC connected to
   one Heltec does not advertise to another, so a spare board cannot silently grab a kart. Your
   bench image checks the UUID from FW_VERSION; this branch now pins both. Confirm this is the
   fleet rule and how pins are recorded per kart.
4. **VESC writes enabled by default** (deviation flagged for owner review). `ENABLE_VESC_WRITES=1`
   because pit STOP/START/mode is the feature under test; `docs/requirements.md` still says
   profile writes stay disabled until link-loss behaviour is validated. A `0` build answers every
   write `rejected`.
5. **Fleet frame** (open): the base decodes both your 47-byte `GK` bench frame and the
   GoKartProtocol frame; which becomes the fleet protocol is for the integration PR. Your
   `integration/command-config` branch last merged this branch at d98c41d (2026-11-05 16:58);
   everything since is only here.
6. **Game layer** (proposal): ECO/NORMAL karts get up to SPORT torque on a 1.0 boost pad. Whether
   the game is wanted, and the pad scale, are owner calls.
7. **Mode table = speed caps** (first cut 2026-11-07, your numbers wanted). Eamon drove kart 2 on
   the old modes and could not tell them apart: they only moved the motor-current scale (80 / 100 /
   140 A), which shapes the first second of a launch and nothing after it. Kart firmware 0.2.2 makes
   a mode a top-speed cap plus a torque scale, written the way SLOW already was (ERPM from the
   controller's own poles / gear / wheel): **ECO 15 mph + 0.50, NORMAL 25 mph + 0.75, SPORT
   uncapped + 1.0**; a boost pad lifts the cap one mode up for its 5 s. All of it is
   `firmware/kart-heltec-v4/config.h MODES[]`, one line per mode; the pit / kart Pi / simulator
   copies are checked against it by the firmware tests. Two things only you can settle: (a) the
   numbers; (b) **how many controllers a kart has.** The temp-limit write reaches the BLE controller
   only (`forward_can` 0 in VescLink.cpp); if a kart runs two VESCs over CAN the second never saw any
   mode, which would also explain "no difference". Before trusting the caps, check the configured
   drivetrain once: drive a straight at a steady speed and compare GPS mph with wheel mph (kart
   display and pit log have both); the cap is only as right as `si_gear_ratio` / `si_wheel_diameter`
   in the controller. The kart logs `baseline_suspect` when the limits it reads at link-up look like
   its own caps left by a previous Heltec session (fix: key the kart off and on).
9. **Remembered controller baseline** (0.2.6, 2026-11-10; flagged against "no saved-profile restore"). After a
   Heltec reboot with the controller still on, the link-up read returns the previous session's temporary caps and
   the kart clamps every later cap to them (2026-11-09: stuck at ECO's 15 mph, boosts and ROCKET did nothing).
   0.2.6 keeps an NVS copy of a clean link-up read per controller UUID and uses it as the ceiling for its own
   temporary writes when the live read looks like its leftovers; it also adopts the mode the live limits match
   as the request (read-only). It never writes the remembered values to the controller. If you would rather the
   kart stay clamped until a key cycle, that is a one-line revert; say so.
8. **Kart-to-kart game bytes in telemetry** (2026-11-09 evening, owner request; protocol change for your
   sign-off). Multiplayer freeplay (invite other karts, item boxes give a SHELL / LIGHTNING, fire it at a
   kart within 25 m, the target gets a 4 s / 3 s timed SLOW 5) rides on seven bytes appended to
   GkTelemetry (54 bytes, 25.7 ms on air; 46/47-byte packets still accepted everywhere; a kart sends the
   47-byte packet while idle). Everything is kart-to-kart over the existing telemetry; the pit only
   observes (`session`/`score` badges). Contract and rules: docs/freeplay-multiplayer.md. Open for you: whether
   the fleet wants this at all, the 25 m / 4 s / 3 s numbers, and whether the pit should be able to end a game.
   Also owner 2026-11-09: freeplay starts in ECO, a BOOST is NORMAL (0.75, 25 mph) for 5 s and a ROCKET (was
   SUPER) is SPORT (1.0, uncapped) for 8 s; firmware 0.2.5 lifts the cap to the mode whose scale the boost
   reaches (0.2.4 lifted exactly one mode).

## Doc drift to reconcile

- `docs/requirements.md` and `AGENTS.md` still list remote stop and geofence enforcement as
  deferred and profile writes as disabled; this branch implements remote STOP, SLOW, BOOST, RACE
  and game zones (zones are not enforcement). Owner decision needed before the docs change.
- `docs/requirements.md` says no speed caps or current values are set as final; kart firmware
  0.2.2 writes 15 / 25 mph caps and 0.50 / 0.75 scales for ECO / NORMAL (decision 7, first cut).
- `firmware/README.md`: header says "not yet run on hardware"; protocol paragraph says 46-byte
  packets at 1 Hz in 100 ms slots (now 47 bytes, 2 Hz, 50 ms slots, 27-byte beacon); STOP ramp
  listed as 0.6/0.3/0.1/0 over 1.5 s (code: 0.5/0.2/0.0 at 150 ms steps); "Not verified" list is
  stale; the table omits the repeater.
- Kart `help` text omits `gpscold`, `gpspin` and `gpsline`.
- `pit/README.md` status table and "Kiosk approach" still say the T-Beam link, first boot and
  kiosk are untested on hardware; `pit/sdcard/README.md` says the kit has not been booted.
- `kart/README.md` status table says first boot, `/dev/heltec` and the kiosk are untested on a
  Pi 3 B (verified 2026-11-06 16:26); its SLOW bullet still describes inference only.
- `tools/bench/e2e_bench.py` promises no write to a kart with a linked VESC without
  `--allow-writes`, but its race check always sends `race 3` (a 3 s grid hold at scale 0).
- `config/project.json` status is still `hardware_baseline_captured_application_not_implemented`.

## The connected kart: findings that matter

See the [full report and capture](hardware/vesc/baseline-kart/2026-11-05/README.md).

| Finding | Consequence |
| --- | --- |
| Firmware 6.00; hardware `75_100_V2`; firmware name `no_hw_limits` | Verify physical controller model/rating and firmware provenance before tuning. The name is not a rating. |
| Motor current max 140 A; battery current max 100 A | Old README's 240 A battery claim is not this kart's current baseline. |
| Absolute-current threshold 240 A | This is a different setting, not the battery-current limit. |
| Motor braking current 0 A; battery regen allowance -100 A | Preserve present behavior; do not enable regen while porting profiles. |
| Field-weakening current max 95 A | Existing behavior to investigate, not evidence it should be increased. |
| ADC and UART; Current Reverse Button | Consistent with hardwired throttle/reverse and a UART BLE module. BLE UUID/device identity still needs verification. |
| Motor-temperature sensor disabled; owner confirms no sensors wired | Show unavailable; do not interpret 0 C as a cool motor. ESC sensing is separate. |
| CAN multi-ESC enabled; controller ID 69 | Configuration does not prove a second controller is physically present. |
| 14 poles, ratio ~2.76923, wheel diameter 0.406 m | Configured values only. Since kart 0.2.2 the mode speed caps (and SLOW) are computed from them: verify once by comparing GPS mph with wheel mph on a straight. |

GET_MCCONF/GET_APPCONF capture current runtime settings. The saved flash configuration has not
been independently established. The runtime scale was 1.0, but that alone does not prove there
are no temporary overrides elsewhere. Telemetry queries can reset the controller's averaging
accumulators as part of ordinary GET_VALUES behaviour, but do not change drive settings.

## Agreed behaviour (owner decisions)

- The owner approved the [initial telemetry fields](docs/requirements.md#agreed-telemetry-fields):
  kart identity/time, separate wheel/GPS speed, battery voltage/current, motor current, ESC
  temperature, faults, GPS position/quality and connection status. Motor temperature remains
  unavailable. Schema, update rates and stale thresholds were left open (this branch uses 2 Hz
  radio, online <= 5 s, stale <= 15 s: proposals).
- The Heltec owns the VESC link and kart supervisory logic; the Pi is display only. USB VESC
  access remains available for inspection. See [architecture](docs/architecture.md).
- Preserve hardwired driver inputs and mechanical brakes.
- Keep three profile names (ECO / NORMAL / SPORT). Desired eventual behaviour is top-speed limits
  with strong acceleration; do not replace current limits based on historical code.
- Losing the pit radio link should not stop the kart.
- **Reliability first:** loss of display, Heltec, BLE, GPS or pit communication must leave the ESC
  running its installed firmware and current active settings. This supersedes the earlier
  saved-configuration restore requirement. Do not change profiles, reset, stop or write settings
  because a link drops or returns. Reconnect read-only, reconcile actual state, never replay cached
  commands. Hardwired inputs and normal ESC protections remain authoritative; bench verification
  is still required. See [acceptance checks](docs/requirements.md#reliability-and-link-loss-behavior).
- Drivers see their own and other kart positions, with online and race-entry filters.
- MPH. Beginner mode hides driver-facing fault alerts, while pit/logging retains them.
- Driver messages, gradual remote stop and geofence enforcement were deferred (see Doc drift and
  decision 4). A future geofence should work locally without a pit link; the Heltec/BLE design
  cannot guarantee enforcement after a Heltec/BLE failure.
- BLE from the Heltec to the VESC on every kart (2026-11-05, see decision 3).

## Drift cutoff: what is known vs unknown

The owner reports torque cutting out during sustained drifting. We have one stationary sample
with no active fault, which does not rule out transient faults, current/voltage limiting or
thermal issues while driving. Log motor/battery current, pack voltage, ERPM, duty, ESC
temperature, throttle where available, fault state and requested/applied profile together. Read
BMS status only if a BMS is actually connected. Drift wheel speed and GPS ground speed differ; a
wheel-RPM limiter can cut propulsion during a drift at modest ground speed. Do not conclude that
higher current or fault thresholds are the fix without an event log and verified ratings.

## Earlier next-work list (2026-11-05, still valid where not done)

1. Identify the controller's commercial model, motor/battery/BMS ratings and BLE module; check
   whether all development karts match. Display USB goes to "5V IN + TOUCH", not the power-only port.
2. Establish the saved-config baseline without overwriting settings; do not power-cycle or change
   firmware merely to fill a documentation gap.
3. Heltec BLE telemetry spike: device selection, fragmentation and reconnect done on the bench;
   latency under concurrent GPS/LoRa/USB load and independent Heltec power/reset still to measure.
4. Eight-kart simulator and kart/pit views: done (simulated).
5. Heltec serial contract and two-radio bench link: done; eight-kart load test still to do.
6. Bench-verify accessory/link failures and reconnect (no state change, unchanged active settings,
   hardwired input response) before enabling profile writes.
7. Investigate drift cutoff with logs, then propose any tuning as a separate change.

## History

**2026-11-09 (evening, multiplayer freeplay)**
- Owner: "single player and multiplayer freeplay, invite other online karts, mystery boxes give cached
  shells etc., when close enough to another kart press it on the display and shell them into slow mode
  for a few seconds"; then "2 boost modes: start in ECO, regular boost = NORMAL, rocket icon = SPORT".
- Built and committed (f266445 firmware/protocol/pit, b646c20 kart Pi + dash): docs/freeplay-multiplayer.md
  is the contract. Seven game bytes on GkTelemetry (54 bytes; 46/47 still accepted; idle karts keep sending
  47), kart 0.2.5 `session host|join N|leave` / `attack N|all shell|lightning` with game/hit/attack lines,
  hits = timed SLOW 5 (shell 4 s, lightning 3 s) through the 0.2.4 timed-slow path; kart Pi FreeplayGame
  multiplayer state + POST /api/freeplay host/join/leave/use + dash UI (invite card, held-item button, HIT
  flash, score); BOOST = `boost 5 0.75` (NORMAL), ROCKET (was SUPER) = `boost 8 1.0` (SPORT), firmware cap
  lift follows the boost's scale.
- Verified: tools/run_tests.sh 7 suites / 262 tests ALL PASSED; integrated headless run on the sim (kart 3
  hosting, kart 5 joining): invite -> join -> shell held -> fired at K5 at 22.6 m -> acked, score 1 -> hit
  by K3 -> SLOW 5 MPH banner, slow_mph 5 for 4 s then 0. Live: kart 2's Heltec on 0.2.5 by OTA 19:53 (VESC
  link up, mode ECO, no writes at boot), `session host` -> game lines at 1 Hz, the pit on base 0.2.1 marks
  the kart stale while it hosts (54-byte packets) and online again after `session leave`; kart Pi deployed
  20:04 (multi.fw_ok true). Freeplay was switched off and its course reset at the kart screen at 19:59
  (before the deploy), so the display shows freeplay OFF until the driver taps FREEPLAY again.
- Owed: base + repeater reflash to 0.2.2 (images in firmware/releases, see Open); a second 0.2.5 kart to
  play against (kart 1 is on Colin's old build); real-track numbers for 25 m / 4 s / 3 s.


Condensed from the dated sections this file accumulated. Times are local (ET).

**2026-11-05**
- Repository scaffold, requirements, architecture, hardware inventory (Colin). Eight owner photos
  archived: LESOWN L7 7" 1024x600, Heltec HTIT-WB32LAF V4.3 with L76K, Pi 3 Model B V1.2.
- USB read-only VESC capture on `/dev/cu.usbmodem3041` (session-specific; never hardcode it).
  No writes, firmware update, reboot, motor test, CAN enumeration or terminal command.
- Eamon's firmware starter: kart node, base, shared libraries, pit station (26 tests). Both
  sketches compile (esp32 core 3.3.8); temp-limit payload checked against bldc `release_6_00`;
  mcconf offsets from the pinned schema. Base boots on the T-Beam S3 (PMU, SX1262, GNSS
  detected); the T-Beam shipped with Meshtastic and needed a 1200-baud touch for the first flash.
- Radio aligned to Colin's bench transmitter (915.0 MHz, BW500, SF7, CR4/5, sync 0x12, preamble 8);
  the base also decodes his 47-byte `GK` frame (`"bench": true`).
- 16:20 bench: pit live (kiosk 1024x600, SkyFi imagery local-only, site presets); kart 2 received
  at 1 Hz with zero loss, -13 dBm / 13.5 dB; GPS detected at 9600 (no fix indoors); ping applied in
  ~1 s; OTA into the BLE build. **Owner decision: BLE on every kart**; pinned-address-only
  connection (`./build.sh kart` builds BLE; `kart-uart` remains as the wired alternative, which
  was the earlier proposal). Colin's bench image held its VESC so the scan saw none, as expected.
- Bench plan proposed to Colin: prove reception first with his bench image (`id 1`,
  `tx on antenna-confirmed`), then run the command-capable kart build wheels-up. He flashed the
  kart build the same evening.
- 17:00-17:30: kart 2 fix outside (5-11 sats). SkyFi cut 25-40 m off at the shop (registration
  extrapolated from the island), bench preset uses the state ortho; the kart reading is 27 m east of
  the geocoded "50 Day St" point, both on the Harborside block, so the address point may be the
  wrong building (a phone reading at the Heltec's spot would settle it). Pit beacon (1 Hz),
  beacon sync, 2 Hz reporting with 50 ms slots, VESC UUID pin, loss counter, dead reckoning, phone
  page `/m`. A base build that queued commands for the tail window delayed them up to 20 s;
  commands now go out immediately unless the base has PPS. Ping applied in 2 s, stop -> no_vesc
  in 1 s, start -> rejected. Colin's kart 1 at 2 Hz with VESC over BLE (78.4 V, 24 C, fault 0),
  received by pit and kart 2, receives nothing itself.
- 17:40: first remote STOP on a real VESC. Root cause of earlier silent writes: the VESC BLE UART
  module negotiates MTU 23, so the 42-byte temp-config write is sent in 20-byte chunks. Writes echo
  the limits read from that controller at link-up, never capture constants. SLOW (ERPM cap from
  the controller's own poles/gear/wheel) and the regen brake request added.
- Colin's branches the same afternoon: `firmware/heltec-bench-ota` (bench BLE telemetry, LoRa TX,
  GPS, authenticated OTA), `diagnostics/removable-bench-control` (direct BLE motor-test evidence),
  `integration/command-config` (integrates this stack up to d98c41d, OLED status, gated writes).

**2026-11-06**
- Afternoon: repeater built (relay bit 0x80, one hop, 25 ms delay inside the slot); 100 % relayed,
  0 drops, ping 0.3 s. `slow_mph` in telemetry (47-byte packet; 46-byte still accepted); not
  exercised on a live VESC (Colin's VESC was off, `vesc_link false`). Base re-flashed from the Pi
  (`esptool --no-stub`, app at 0x10000); kart 2 by `espota.py -i 192.168.151.44 -p 3232`.
- 16:26: kart Pi 3 B first boot (see Verified). Open points: Pi 3 B Wi-Fi is 2.4 GHz only (does
  McLab offer 2.4 GHz?), Heltec power from the Pi's USB vs separate, pre-loading a map before the
  first pit contact.
- Repeater OLED: on the second T-Beam the QMC6310 compass answers at 0x3C (register 0 reads 0x80)
  and the screen sits at 0x3D; the repeater now picks the address itself.
- 16:43: repeater heartbeat (GK_MSG_REPEATER_INFO every 5 s); pit chip, LOST after 20 s.
- 16:53-17:22: game layer (boost override in firmware, zones contract, pit editor + laps, kart
  geofence + HUD; built partly by subagents), GPS upgrades (GPS+BDS+GLONASS, GGA+RMC, 5 Hz, `gps`
  USB line, hdop/fix_age/base fix on the self line), pit GPS correction (gated >= 6 sats, < 25 m).
  Indoor bench fixes were 200 m off and frozen: the building, not the map (OSM puts 50 Day St
  within 30 m of the marker).
- 17:31: duplicate `gc` declaration in the pit's `updateTop` was a SyntaxError that killed every
  pit page; fixed.
- 17:33-17:54: shop demo track in the lot south of 50 Day St; race start (grid hold +
  synchronized GO on the shared clock), item boxes, track route; base keeps `issued_utc` on
  retransmits so late receivers launch on the same GO; kart remembers the GPS baud and hard-resets
  the L76K when no baud locks for 48 s. Live bench tool: 16 checks pass.
- 18:19: GPS settled at 9600 baud at 5 Hz (the earlier 115200 setting is superseded), pins never
  swapped, console diagnostics; kart 2's L76K found dead (Known issue 1).
- 18:37: UI polish, shared synthesized sounds, STOP RACE, race length, final results, HDMI audio.
  Kart 2 deployed and checked live; pit not deployed (Pi down). Tests then: pit 43 + 3, kart 70 +
  9 + 5.
- Evening: pit Pi reboots; Wi-Fi lost at 18:10 and logs gone (Known issue 3).
- 20:33: beacon carries race state and positions (27 bytes; 22-byte beacons still accepted).
- 20:45: kart HUD race-position badge with chimes (78 kart core tests).
- 20:59: pit hardening (root cause of the Wi-Fi loss: firstboot's `nmcli modify` turned the
  cloud-init profile into `/etc/netplan/90-NM-*.yaml`, which the power cuts truncated to 0 bytes;
  journald was `Storage=volatile`), race positions to the base, pace car recorder; 53 core + 6 e2e
  pit tests; deployed live.

**2026-11-07**
- 12:22-12:25: radio power 0.2.1 flashed on the repeater and the pit base (see Current state).
- Evening: kart dash hood reworked (the Heltec plugs into the Pi inside the bay; CAD lives outside
  this repo). Kart firmware 0.2.2: modes became top-speed caps + torque scales after Eamon drove
  kart 2 and could not tell ECO from SPORT (decision 7); firmware host tests check the pit / kart /
  simulator copies of the mode table; all 213 offline tests pass; image built, not flashed.

**2026-11-09**
- Phone page (`/m`) reworked so it does everything the operator page does: one-row chip strip
  (+ base GPS chip), STOP ALL / START ALL + SLOW / BOOST / ALL ECO / NORMAL / SPORT in about 190 px,
  tabs KARTS / MAP / RACE / LOG with `#tab` deep links, kart DETAILS bottom sheet, full ZONES editor
  and PACE CAR recorder as drawers on a full-height map, landscape layout with the fleet buttons in a
  left column. Kiosk and operator page unchanged. Headless screenshots only (simulator); not yet
  tried on a real phone. New unit test keeps the phone and operator pages' shared element ids in step.
- Kart driver display: full-bleed map with a HUD (owner: "I want the map to be bigger", speed and mode
  small or over the map). The 380 px dash column is gone; chips + lap panel top-left, map buttons
  top-right, a 252 x 156 translucent speed card (arc, gear badge, one battery line) bottom-left, the
  ECO / NORMAL / SPORT strip (160 x 64 buttons) bottom-centre with the boost meter shown only while it
  matters, sound bottom-right; the canvas scale bar moved above the speed card (one app.js line).
  Headless 1024x600 screenshots only (simulator: driving, no fix, no VESC, STOPPED, SLOW, race,
  finish, roulette, under-voltage); not yet deployed to kart 2 or tried with gloves in sun.
- Kart display SUN mode (the panel's backlight cannot be raised): opaque black HUD with white edges,
  yellow active mode/gear, contrast-boosted map photo, wider outlined track band; on by default
  (`sun_mode`), SUN map button toggles it per device. Headless screenshots only, not yet seen in sun.

- 2026-11-09 (late afternoon, Eamon + Claude): kart 2's first outdoor drive with the whole stack, and the
  wheels-up test that 0.2.2 was waiting for. Wheels off the ground, VESC on, commands from the pit API
  with the throttle held: SPORT uncapped (41,100 ERPM at duty 0.94), ECO plateau ~6,024 ERPM (cap 6,115 =
  15 mph), SLOW 5 mph ~2,137 (cap 2,038), NORMAL seen earlier at ~10,080 with duty backed off to 0.44
  (cap 10,191 = 25 mph); STOP -> scale 0 / stopped, START restores; every command acked and confirmed by
  read-back. SLOW stays through mode changes until START (as designed). Before that, the Heltec rebooted
  60 times in an hour (every 15-130 s, controller link flapping, GPS cold-starting): it stopped the moment
  the kart's power was redone, and 0 reboots followed in 25+ min with the controller linked, so it was
  the Pi's 5 V (Known issues 10), not firmware. The charge-only USB-C cable in the hood bay was the reason
  the kart Pi never saw the Heltec (hub ports showed power, no connect; the flash cable fixed it). Drive:
  ~100 m from the pit before RSSI hit -84 dBm / SNR 7 (about 30 dB worse than open air: the pit T-Beam
  sits inside the shop next to the Pi 4), 7 packets lost of ~1,500. Range plan in order: pit antenna
  outside on a mast (3-6 dBi omni, short low-loss coax), kart whip vertical on the hood turret, repeater
  mid-course, then SF8/BW250 at 1 Hz (slot plan decision). Pit Pi lost power at 16:45 and rebooted
  (journal ends abruptly). Kart display: full-screen map HUD + SUN mode shipped and deployed the same day.

- 2026-11-09 (evening): kart 0.2.3 by OTA. Eamon: "eco and normal are still way too slow". The drive log
  (GPS km/h vs ERPM, 40 moving samples + the 19 mph / 19,691 ERPM peak) gives 0.00159 km/h per ERPM where the
  controller's si_* numbers (14 poles, 2.769, 0.406 m) predict 0.00395: the caps were 6 / 10 mph on the road,
  SLOW 5 was 2 mph. Fix: `SPEED_CAL_DEFAULT 2.48` in config.h applied in mphToErpm (per-kart `speedcal X`,
  status `speed_cal`); pitcore/kartcore `WHEEL_CAL` so wheel mph agrees (UI no longer says uncalibrated);
  sim_heltec matched. Also: a SET_MODE from the pit clears SLOW (Eamon: "pressing the other buttons should
  take it out of slow"); the driver's own mode buttons do not. The proper fix is the si_* values in VESC
  Tool (Colin), after which speedcal goes back to 1.0.

- 2026-11-09 (night): kart display FREEPLAY (owner: random boxes to drive onto, boosts and slow-downs, "runs
  without the pit"). `kartcore.FreeplayGame` records one lap of the kart's own GPS as the course, keeps 3
  item boxes on it (respawn 3 s after pickup, >= 20 m away, new id) and feeds the normal game engine, so the
  item roll / roulette / safety rules are the existing ones; the pit's own game (enabled with zones) pauses
  it. FREEPLAY map button (tap on/off, hold 2 s new course), `#freeChip`, `POST /api/freeplay`, config
  `freeplay` / `freeplay_boxes`, state in `cache/freeplay.json`. Simulator + headless screenshots only; not
  deployed. Open for the owner: freeplay keeps running when the pit's game is switched OFF (the brief), so
  the pit master switch no longer silences a kart whose driver turned freeplay on.
- 2026-11-09 (night, after the first freeplay drive, "lotta fun"): freeplay switch-on sends `mode 0` (ECO base,
  so a BOOST's cap lift is felt; skipped while STOPPED / grid hold / paused); boosts stack (remaining + new,
  <= 30 s, larger scale; `boost_stacked`); mud = `slow 5 4` (timed SLOW, `mud_slow_secs`) when the Heltec's
  status `fw` is kart-0.2.4+, else the old `boost 4 0.5` (0.2.3 would read it as a permanent slow). Simulator
  reports fw `sim-kart-0.2.4` (`--fw-old` = 0.2.3) and `slow_mph`. Tests only; not deployed or driven.

## Collaboration and delivery state

Repository: `git@github.com:colinfost3r/GoKart-Control.git`. The owner requests ongoing pushes
of coherent, checked milestones; fetch and reconcile before pushing; focused branches and PRs
for parallel work ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). No team members have been invited by
this project and no messages sent on anyone's behalf. Never put credentials or the pit password
into source control.
- Evening, 20:10-20:40: bench power-cycled (both Pis rebooted about 20:10; the T-Beam base stayed
  up). Kart 2 Heltec flashed 0.2.2 over WiFi (`espota.py -i 192.168.151.44 -p 3232 -f
  firmware/build/kart-heltec-v4/kart-heltec-v4.ino.bin`: OTA takes the app image, not the merged one;
  the pit saw the reboot). Pit and kart Pi deployed with `--install` (5d2f891; the leftover
  `/etc/default/gokart-kart-kiosk` removed). Ping to kart 2 from the new pit build applied in under
  2 s. VESC off, so the wheels-up `mode 0` read-back is still owed. Found: the Heltec was not on the
  kart Pi's USB (the Pi saw only the touch panel; the kart ran on WiFi + LoRa alone), the kart Pi 3 B
  was browning out (Known issues 10), and kart 2's GPS fixes again (10 sats). Kart display gained the
  pit's health chip.
