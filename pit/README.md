# Pit station (Pi 4): server, touch kiosk, simulator, SD card kit

The pit side of GoKart Control: a Python service that owns the T-Beam S3 LoRa
modem over USB serial, keeps the authoritative fleet/race/command state, logs
the session, and serves a shared web UI to the Pi's own touchscreen (kiosk)
and to password-authenticated browsers on the LAN.

Contract with the modem: [`firmware/base-tbeam-s3/SERIAL_PROTOCOL.md`](../firmware/base-tbeam-s3/SERIAL_PROTOCOL.md)
(base-0.1.0). Telemetry conventions: [`docs/requirements.md`](../docs/requirements.md#agreed-telemetry-fields).

## Status: what is verified and what is not

Eamon’s November 5 16:20 handoff reports the Pi 4 kiosk/T-Beam running and kart 2
LoRa reception, ping and OTA verified without a VESC. Those later hardware
reports supersede the original “untested” rows below for initial Pi/kiosk/radio
bring-up; unplug recovery, first-boot provisioning and physical motor commands
still need separate checks. See [shared handoff](../HANDOFF.md).

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Server + simulator command loop (TCP and pty), outcome table, SSE stream, login, logs | **Tested on the Mac** (macOS, Python 3.13, pyserial 3.5) with `pit/tests/` and manual runs |
| Kiosk and operator pages | **Rendered on the Mac** in headless Chrome at 1024x600 and 1400 px wide against the simulator. Touch, press-and-hold and the kiosk detail sheet were not exercised with a real touchscreen |
| `gen_cloudinit.py` | **Run on the Mac** with a dummy Wi-Fi password; output inspected (user-data, two-network netplan, payload contents with no secrets/logs) |
| `flash.sh` safety checks | **Run on the Mac**: refuses `/dev/disk0` and a non-external disk. No card has been flashed with this kit |
| Real T-Beam S3 serial link, udev `/dev/tbeam` rule, reconnect on unplug | **Untested** (no T-Beam connected; product string in the rule is from the brief, not read from a board) |
| First boot on the Pi 4, apt package names, NetworkManager priorities | **Untested** |
| cage + Chromium kiosk on Raspberry Pi OS Trixie Lite, HDMI 1024x600, USB touch | **Untested**; see "Kiosk approach" for confidence |
| Python 3.11 compatibility (Trixie ships 3.13) | Not run on 3.11; code avoids 3.12+ features |
| Drivetrain numbers behind wheel mph, battery % curve | Contract values; **uncalibrated**, labelled in the UI |

Simulated karts are not real karts: whenever the source is the simulator the UI
shows a striped SIMULATION banner (driven by the simulator's own
`{"t":"log","msg":"SIMULATION"}` and `stat.fw = "sim-..."`).

## Layout

```text
pit/
  server/pit_server.py     HTTP server, SSE, auth, session log, wiring (stdlib + pyserial)
  server/pitcore.py        fleet state, staleness, derived values, command delivery (pure logic)
  server/link.py           T-Beam link: serial auto-find + reconnect, or TCP to the simulator
  server/static/           index.html (operator), kiosk.html (1024x600 touch), app.js, style.css, login.html
  server/map/              map presets + public CT ECO imagery; licensed assets local-only
  server/config.example.json   copy to config.json (gitignored): shared password etc.
  sim/sim_tbeam.py         simulated T-Beam (pty or TCP), eight karts, honours commands
  tests/                   test_core.py (unit), test_e2e.py (simulator + server)
  install.sh               runs ON THE PI; idempotent install/update
  deploy.sh                Mac -> Pi rsync + restart
  systemd/, kiosk/, udev/  units, PAM file + Chromium launcher, /dev/tbeam rule
  sdcard/                  SD card flashing kit (see sdcard/README.md)

```

## Run it locally (Mac or Linux)

```sh
# terminal 1: simulated T-Beam over a pseudo-terminal; prints e.g. /dev/ttys004
python3 pit/sim/sim_tbeam.py
# terminal 2
python3 pit/server/pit_server.py --port /dev/ttys004
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/        # operator page
open http://127.0.0.1:8080/kiosk   # touch layout (best in a 1024x600 window)
```

TCP instead of a pty: `python3 pit/sim/sim_tbeam.py --tcp 7878` and
`python3 pit/server/pit_server.py --tcp 127.0.0.1:7878`. Simulator scenario
flags (`--fault 5 --nofix 6 --flaky 7 --offline 8 --novesc 0 --loss 0.1`) are
described in `sim_tbeam.py --help`; 0 disables one. With a real T-Beam, run the
server with no arguments: it tries `/dev/tbeam`, a USB 303a:1001 match,
`/dev/serial/by-id/*`, `/dev/ttyACM*`, then `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`.

Requests from 127.0.0.1 skip the login. Other browsers need the shared
password in `pit/server/config.json` (copy `config.example.json`); with no
password set, remote browsers are refused.

Tests (no hardware needed):

```sh
python3 -I pit/tests/test_core.py
python3 -I pit/tests/test_e2e.py
```

## Behaviour (implemented here; proposed until reviewed)

- **Fleet state.** A kart is `online` if a `tele` arrived within 5 s, `stale`
  within 15 s, else `offline`, or `never` heard. Link freshness, the VESC group
  (updated only from samples with `vesc_link: true`) and the GPS group (only
  from samples with a valid fix) each keep their own age, so a live radio link
  never makes old VESC data look current. Missing values stay `null`; a
  missing fault is shown as "fault unknown", never as "no fault"; a stale
  `fault: 0` is shown as "no fault (stale)". Positions are never moved to 0,0.
- **Derived values.** Battery % = linear 60.0 V (0 %) to 84.0 V (100 %),
  clamped, flagged "under load" when |batt_a| > 20 A. Wheel mph uses the
  contract formula and is labelled uncalibrated. GPS mph = gps_kph x 0.621371.
- **Commands.** Seq 1-255 rolling, persisted in `logs/cmdseq.json` across
  restarts, and never a seq that any kart currently reports as `last_cmd_seq`
  (the kart caches recent request identities/results, so reuse needs care).
  Retransmit every 1.5 s, up to 5 retransmits (6 sends), until every addressed
  kart that is online echoes the seq; per-kart outcomes come from `cmd_result`.
  A fleet command has eight outcomes: `pending`, `received`, `accepted`,
  `applied`, `no_vesc`, `rejected`, `unknown` (kart-reported), `no_ack`
  (no echo, outcome unknown), `offline` (not online when sent), `superseded`,
  `cancelled`, `link_lost`. Late echoes still update the table.
  Commands are serialized per kart (a queued command waits while the kart owes
  an echo, or up to 4 s while it reports `accepted`). STOP never queues: it
  cancels queued commands for its karts and marks in-flight ones superseded;
  retransmits of an older fleet command then go out addressed per kart so they
  cannot re-trigger a kart that has since handled the STOP. If the serial link
  drops, in-flight commands become `link_lost` and are never replayed after
  reconnect (requirements: no backlog execution).
- **Race.** Entered karts and race mode are shared server state. RACE ON sends
  the selected mode then START to entered karts and STOP to the others (fleet
  commands when all eight are entered). RACE OFF only clears the flag. The
  online/entered filters are per-browser presentation only.
- **Logs.** `logs/session-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.jsonl`, one file per server start:
  every serial line received (`rx`) and sent (`tx`), operator actions (`op`,
  with operator name and IP), command lifecycle and link events. Download from
  the operator page or `GET /api/log/download`.
The simulator defaults to 2 Hz telemetry per kart (`--rate 1` for the older
rate). Radio reception is independent of SSE refresh and the moving map's
20 fps interpolation; interpolation does not create new GPS fixes. The kiosk
includes Eamon's rolling 1-minute packet-loss and pit-link RSSI displays.

- **HTTP.** `/` operator UI, `/kiosk`, `/events` (SSE, ~4 Hz full state),
  `GET /api/state`, `GET /api/log/recent?n=100[&lines=1]`, `POST /cmd`
  `{"cmd":"stop|start|mode|ping","kart":1-8|255,"arg":0-2}`, `POST /api/race`
  `{"entered":[...],"mode":0-2,"active":true|false}`, `GET /map/package.json`,
  `/map/<file>`, `/healthz`. `/map/*` and `/healthz` need no login (kart
  displays fetch the map on the pit Wi-Fi).

## On the Pi

Flash a card with [`sdcard/`](sdcard/README.md); first boot installs everything.
Pi: hostname `gokart-pit` (`gokart-pit.local` via avahi), user `pit`, app in
`/opt/gokart-pit`, config `/opt/gokart-pit/server/config.json` (mode 600).

Services:
- `gokart-pit.service`: `python3 /opt/gokart-pit/server/pit_server.py` as `pit`
  (group dialout), `Restart=always`. No Wi-Fi dependency.
- `gokart-kiosk.service`: cage + Chromium on tty1 (below).
- udev: `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-gokart-tbeam.rules` makes `/dev/tbeam`.

```sh
journalctl -u gokart-pit -f
journalctl -u gokart-kiosk -b
sudo systemctl restart gokart-pit gokart-kiosk
udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyACM0 | grep -iE 'idVendor|idProduct|product'   # check the rule's match
```

### Updating the app later

From the Mac, with the Pi on the same network:

```sh
pit/deploy.sh                    # rsync pit/ -> pit@gokart-pit.local:/opt/gokart-pit, restart services
pit/deploy.sh gokart-pit.local --install   # also re-run install.sh (packages, units, udev)
```

deploy.sh keeps the Pi's `server/config.json`, `logs/` and map imagery. By hand:
`rsync -av --exclude logs/ --exclude server/config.json pit/ pit@gokart-pit.local:/opt/gokart-pit/`
then `ssh pit@gokart-pit.local sudo systemctl restart gokart-pit gokart-kiosk`.
Change the web password by editing `/opt/gokart-pit/server/config.json` and
restarting `gokart-pit` (logged-in browsers must log in again).

### Kiosk approach (untested on hardware; medium confidence)

`gokart-kiosk.service` runs `cage -d -s -- start-chromium.sh` as `pit` on tty1,
with `PAMName=gokart-kiosk` (`/etc/pam.d/gokart-kiosk` includes
`pam_systemd`). That PAM session registers a logind session on seat0/tty1, and
cage's libseat logind backend uses it to open DRM and input devices without
root and without seatd. This is the pattern from cage's own "Starting Cage on
boot with systemd" wiki page; `getty@tty1` is disabled (SSH and tty2-6 remain).
Chromium runs with `--kiosk --ozone-platform=wayland --touch-events=enabled`
and a dedicated profile; the service waits for `/healthz` before launching and
restarts if Chromium exits.

Why medium: the pattern is documented and used on Debian/Arch, but it has not
been run on this OS image. Specific risks to check first boot:
1. Package name: install.sh tries `chromium`, then `chromium-browser`.
2. If cage logs "Could not open seat" / libseat errors: `sudo apt install seatd`,
   `sudo systemctl enable --now seatd`, add `pit` to the `_seat` (or `video`)
   group per the Debian seatd package, and set `Environment=LIBSEAT_BACKEND=seatd`
   in the unit.
3. No picture: check `journalctl -u gokart-kiosk` for "no outputs"; a display
   without usable EDID needs `video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600@60` in cmdline.txt.
4. Touch offset/rotation: with one output, cage maps touch to it; a rotated
   mount needs `wlr-randr` or a udev calibration matrix (not handled).

The alternative considered was labwc (Raspberry Pi OS's own Wayland desktop)
with autologin; it pulls in a desktop stack, so cage was chosen as smaller.
