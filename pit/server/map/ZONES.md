# Game zones (Mario Kart layer) — format contract

Zones live in `pit/server/map/zones.json` next to `map.json`. The pit serves the file at
`GET /map/zones.json` (no login, like the map) and lists it in `GET /map/package.json` as
`"zones": "/map/zones.json", "zones_version": <int>`. The kart Pi (kart/server/mapsync.py) re-fetches
the file whenever `zones_version` changes and keeps it in its map cache; it evaluates zones locally
from its own GPS (the Heltec `self` line, 2 Hz) so the game keeps working with no radio and no Wi-Fi.
The pit evaluates the same file against telemetry for the leaderboard. Editing happens on the pit
operator page (`POST /zones`, login) which rewrites the file and bumps `zones_version`.

```json
{
  "version": 3,                 // bumped on every save (= zones_version in package.json)
  "enabled": true,              // master switch: false = karts ignore every zone, pit hides laps
  "zones": [
    {"id": "b1", "type": "boost", "name": "Boost pad", "shape": "circle",
     "lat": 41.093990, "lon": -73.416370, "r_m": 12,
     "scale": 1.0, "secs": 5, "cooldown_s": 20},
    {"id": "m1", "type": "mud", "name": "Mud", "shape": "polygon",
     "points": [[41.0940, -73.4165], [41.0941, -73.4163], [41.0939, -73.4162]],
     "scale": 0.5},
    {"id": "lap", "type": "lapline", "name": "Start / finish", "shape": "line",
     "a": [41.09400, -73.41660], "b": [41.09400, -73.41610], "min_lap_s": 20}
  ]
}
```

Rules every implementation follows:

- **Coordinates** are WGS84 decimal degrees (same as telemetry). Distances in metres on the local
  tangent plane (use the existing `projection()` / `R_EARTH` helpers, cos(lat) scaling for lon).
- **Minimum sizes**: circle `r_m` >= 3 (5 is a good pad outdoors), polygon with >= 3 points; the editor
  refuses smaller. Karts fix at 5 Hz; GPS is still a few metres off, so very small zones can feel random.
- **boost**: on entry the kart Pi sends the Heltec `boost <secs> <scale>` over USB (firmware
  2026-11-06+: `scale` 0.10-1.00, `secs` 1-30; the Heltec auto-reverts to the mode scale when the
  time is up, and STOP/START cancel it). A boost whose scale is above the mode's also lifts the
  mode's speed cap one mode up for the same time (ECO 15 -> 25 mph, NORMAL 25 -> uncapped, SPORT
  unchanged; firmware 0.2.2+), so a pad on a straight is felt by a kart already sitting at its cap;
  mud (scale at or below the mode's) keeps the cap. `scale` is clamped to 1.0 (never above SPORT or
  above the controller's own limits, which the firmware echoes). Re-trigger only after the kart has left the
  zone and `cooldown_s` (default 20) has passed.
- **mud**: while inside, the kart Pi sends a timed mud command and repeats it every 2 s so the
  slow-down lasts as long as the kart is in the zone (plus at most S s, S = kart config
  `mud_slow_secs`, default 4). On Heltec firmware kart-0.2.4+ (the `fw` of its status reply) the
  command is `slow 5 S`: a real 5 mph speed cap for S s, after which the Heltec returns to the
  previous cap by itself (a pit SLOW that was in force stays / comes back; a timed slow never lifts a
  lower pit cap). On older or unknown firmware it is `boost S <scale>` as before, because those builds
  would read `slow 5 4` as a PERMANENT `slow 5` that only START releases. On leaving the kart simply
  stops repeating.
- **stacking** (2026-11-09 night): a boost (pad, item BOOST or SUPER) that fires while the kart's own
  previous boost is still running sends `boost T SCALE` with T = remaining + new seconds, capped at 30
  (the firmware's SECS limit; it simply re-arms) and SCALE = the larger of the two (never above 1.0).
  The kart logs `boost_stacked` with the total. A running mud never stacks: a boost while inside mud
  or while a mud command is still running is suppressed (mud wins), and a mud during a boost replaces it.
- **lapline**: a lap counts when the kart's path (previous fix -> current fix) crosses segment a-b in
  either direction and at least `min_lap_s` has passed since the previous crossing (default 20 s).
  First crossing starts the clock (lap 0 -> "lap 1 running"). Each kart keeps: lap count, last lap,
  best lap, current lap elapsed. The pit does the same per kart from `tele` lines and ranks karts by
  laps completed, then by time of the last crossing (earlier = ahead).
- **Entry hysteresis**: a kart is "inside" when within the shape; "outside" again only once it is
  more than 3 m outside the edge (avoid flapping on the boundary).
- **enabled=false** or a missing file: no triggers, no lap timing; HUD shows the game as off.
- **Safety**: zones never raise the scale above 1.0, never send STOP/START/mode (the only lines are
  `boost` and, for mud on kart-0.2.4+, the timed `slow MPH SECS`), and a pit STOP
  always wins (the firmware clears the override). The pit's master switch is the race director's
  kill for the whole game. SLOW from the pit is not affected by zones (the ERPM cap stays).

Zone ids are short strings unique within the file; the editor generates them. Unknown `type`
values are ignored by karts and shown greyed by the pit so an old kart build never misreads a new
zone kind.

## Race start (added 2026-11-06 evening)

Command `race` (GK_CMD_RACE = 7, arg = seconds until GO, 1-30, default 5) to all karts. Each Heltec
holds its kart at zero power at once (no brake) and releases at `issued_utc + arg` on the shared
GPS/beacon clock, so every kart launches on the same instant; a kart without time releases `arg`
seconds after receipt. The Heltec prints `{"t":"race","kart":N,"event":"countdown","go_in_ms":N,
"secs":S,"go_utc":U}` on receipt and `{"t":"race","kart":N,"event":"go"}` at release; the kart display
shows the countdown lights from these and resets its laps at GO. A pit STOP during the hold keeps the
kart stopped (GO releases nothing until START); START releases early. The pit resets all lap timing
when it sends `race`, and laps count from the first lap-line crossing after GO.

## Item boxes (added 2026-11-06 evening)

Zone `type: "item"` (circle or polygon, same sizes as boost). On entry the KART rolls a random item
locally and applies it at once, showing a short roulette on the HUD: 45 % BOOST (`boost 5 1.0`),
15 % SUPER (`boost 8 1.0`, star animation), 25 % MUD (`slow 5 4` on Heltec kart-0.2.4+, `boost 4 0.5`
on older or unknown firmware; 4 = `mud_slow_secs`), 15 % nothing ("empty box"). BOOST and SUPER stack
on a running boost (see boost/stacking above).
Same cooldown/exit rules as boost pads (`cooldown_s`, default 15). The pit draws item boxes as a
blue/white "?" box and never evaluates their outcome; the kart logs `{"kind":"game","event":"item",
"item":"boost|super|mud|empty"}` to its session log. Items never raise the scale above 1.0 and are
ignored while STOPPED, in grid hold, or with the game off.

## Track route (added 2026-11-06 evening)

`zones.json` may carry a course centreline the driver should follow:
`"track": {"points": [[lat, lon], ...], "closed": true, "width_m": 6}` (2 to 200 points; `closed`
joins the last point to the first). Drawn on the pit as a thin line and on the KART display as a
highlighted route band `width_m` wide with direction chevrons every ~15 m (direction = point order),
brighter ahead of the kart in heading-up mode. The pit editor has a "Track" tool (tap points, Close,
Clear). The kart's demo mode drives along the track when one exists (falling back to a loop through
the zones). The track has no game effect and is ignored by old builds. Version bumps on every save
like the zones.

## Race finish (added 2026-11-06 night)

Command `race` with arg 0 (finish, no position) or 100 + position (101-108). The Heltec releases any
grid hold and prints `{"t":"race","kart":N,"event":"finish","position":P}` (P = 0 when unknown). The
pit sends it per kart: automatically when a kart completes the race length (`POST /race/start`
`"laps": N`), and on STOP RACE (`POST /race/stop`: positions by laps desc, then earliest last crossing,
karts with no completed lap last by id) to every placed kart heard in the last 15 s; karts not heard get
nothing (revised 2026-11-07: they only cost beacon slots). Because a finish releases the grid hold at once,
STOP RACE before GO is ABORT START: the pit sends STOP to all karts instead and clears the race. Lap
crossings during the grid hold never count. After a
finish the pit freezes lap timing (final results) until the next race start or lap reset, and the
kart display shows the checkered FINISH takeover and stops counting laps until the next countdown.

## Freeplay (kart-local, 2026-11-09)

A kart can run its own item-box game with no pit (kart/README.md "Freeplay"). The kart generates a
zones document in this same format (`"version": "freeplay-N"`, `"enabled": true`, `"source": "freeplay"`,
`type: "item"` circles of 4 m with `cooldown_s` 15, plus a closed `track` recorded from one lap of its own
GPS) and runs it through the same engine, so the item contract above applies unchanged (same roll, same
`boost` / mud lines, scale never above 1.0, nothing while STOPPED or in grid hold). Switching freeplay ON
(button or `POST /api/freeplay`) also puts the kart in ECO: one `mode 0` through the kart's normal
command path (as a driver mode tap), logged as `freeplay_mode` (sent / skipped / failed); skipped while
STOPPED, in a grid hold, or when freeplay is not the running game (pit game on, demo); never re-sent on
later ticks or after a restart. ECO's 15 mph cap is the base and a BOOST lifts it one mode up
(firmware `BOOST_LIFTS_CAP`), so boosts are felt. The pit's own game wins: a
pit `zones.json` with `enabled: true` and at least one zone or lap line pauses freeplay on every kart.
The pit never sees freeplay boxes, and freeplay documents are never written to `zones.json`.
